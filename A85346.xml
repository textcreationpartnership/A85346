            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But a perſon of quality, whom to deny any thing, were a great Crime in me, hath forced them out of my Cloſet, whence otherwiſe they never ſhould have come: ſince I had reſolv'd, after ſo many Calumnies indured, never to adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture more into the Publick View, having ſo oftentimes ſighed forth thoſe words of a Roman Prince; <hi>Utinam neſciſſem literas!</hi> But in fine, the Intreaties, and Commands of my friends have prevailed againſt my own Reſolution; and I am forced, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, to this Publication; ſince I could not but foreſee well enough, that my Enemies would not relliſh at all this other Eſſay of my pen: notwithſtanding after all this, I have wherewith to comfort my ſelf; ſince one of the greateſt Prelates of our Age hath

            <p>If thou thinke it ſtrange, that a man of the Church, as I am, ſhould adventure on ſo bold, and daring a Subject, as this ſeems to be; conſider, I pray thee, that many of my Profeſſion have put forth things much more bold then theſe; and even ſuch as have been eſteemed Dangerous too.

<pb facs="tcp:114719:8"/>a Vine: I have ſince found, that it was, becauſe they had heard ſay, and even them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſeen, at leaſt ſome of them, that in the Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> there was a Golden Vine, with it's leaves, and cluſters of grapes, made againſt the wall; as it is deſcribed by <hi>Joſephus.

            <p>In the following Chap. you may adde theſe admirable <hi>Gamahes.</hi> At <hi>Piſa,</hi> in the Church of St. <hi>John,</hi> you have, on a certaine ſtone, an Old Hermite, perfectly drawn by Nature on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but with ſo much exactneſſe, that there ſeemes not to be wanting any thing that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to one of that ſort of men. For he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented in a Deſert, ſuitable to his profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſitting neare a Brooks ſide, with a Clock in his hand. This Naturall piece of Picture, almoſt fully anſwers That, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver St. <hi>Anthony</hi> in. In the Temple of S. <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia,</hi> at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> there is alſo ſeen, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a plain white Marble, the Image of S. <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> cloathed with a Camels skinne; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only defective in this, that Nature hath drawn him but with one foote. At <hi>Ravenna,</hi> in the Church of St. <hi>Vitalis,</hi> there is to be ſeen a <hi>Franciſcan</hi> Frier, naturally drawn, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſtone of an Aſh-colour. At <hi>Sneiberg</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> there was found in the Earth, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine little Statue of a kind of unrefined Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, naturally made; which repreſented, in a
<pb facs="tcp:114719:9"/>round Figure, a man having a little Child at his back: and whoever hath any where ſeene the picture of St. <hi>Chriſtopher,</hi> may eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſhape of this. It is not long ſince there was found, in the <hi>Hercinian</hi> Foreſt, a Stone that naturally repreſented the figure of an old man, with a long beard, and crowned with a Triple Crowne, as the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> is. Obſerve likewiſe that many of theſe Stones, or <hi>Gamahes,</hi> are called all by the ſame name, becauſe they have alwayes the ſame figure. So that, which repreſents the Eyes of a man, is called <hi>Leucophthalmos:</hi> that which beares the figure of a Heart, <hi>Encardia:</hi> that which hath the ſhape of a Tongue repreſented on it, <hi>Gloſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petra:</hi> that which is figured like the Genitals, <hi>Enorchis:</hi> and if it repreſent as well the ſecret parts of man, as of a woman, it is then called <hi>Diphys,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>To the figures that are found in Plants, and Flowers, you may likewiſe adde thoſe which repreſent ſome kind of Letters, or words: as the <hi>Hyacinth,</hi> on which the Poët ſayes, is written the Complaint of the fair <hi>Phoebus,</hi> for having killed <hi>Hyacinthus;</hi> whom he afterward transformed into a Flowre of the ſame name: and this Complaint of his is expreſt in theſe two Letters, <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>As for the diverſe kinds of Figures that wee meet withall in beaſts, (which we have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe examined in the ſame Chapter,) I have found nothing more worthy our admiration, then what I have been lately informed of by Eye-witneſſes: namely, that it is not long ſince, that in diverſe parts of <hi>Poitou</hi> it rained a certaine kind of little creatures, about an Inch in bigneſſe; ſome whereof were in the ſhape of Biſhops, with a Rochet and hood, cloſed up in a ſhell, or skin, ſo admirably, that one would have thought it to have been of burniſhed gold: others were in ſhape like Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, with a Frocke and Cowle: ſome were of a certaine horrid ſhape; and others like I know not what. It is a great wonder, if this Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion come among the <hi>Dutchmen,</hi> if wee have
<pb facs="tcp:114719:10"/>not very ſpeedily ſome ſtrange Interpretation of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> ſuch a one as <hi>Ananias Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raucurius,</hi> and <hi>Raphael Eglinus</hi> have given, (as we ſhall ſhew hereafter) of the dark Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Daniel,</hi> by the help of certaine Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters found upon two Herrings, taken up up-the coaſt of <hi>Norway.</hi> But to paſſe by theſe Fooleries.</p>
            <p>In the Sixth Chapter, where I ſpeake of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe ſorts of <hi>Taliſmans,</hi> and prove their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, according to the opinion of the Eaſterne parts; you muſt take heed, that you mixe not all ſorts of Characters, and figures, indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, with theſe <hi>Taliſmans.</hi> For though many of them beare the Figures of the living creatures deſcribed in the Heavens, which we uſually call Conſtellations, they are not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore preſently to paſſe for true <hi>Taliſmans;</hi> but either ſome kind of Mony; as that of the Duke of <hi>Brunſwicke,</hi> whereon were ingraven all the Celeſtial Signes; and that of <hi>Auguſtus Coeſar,</hi> on which he cauſed the Sign of <hi>Capricorn</hi> to be figured; for no other reaſon, but only in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory that he was born under that Signe. Or elſe theſe Figures are only ſome Myſtical Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemes, under which the Ancients couched ſome certaine Philoſophical Secret. Such was <hi>Neſtor's</hi> Silver Goblet, in <hi>Homer,</hi> whereon the <hi>Pleiades</hi> were ingraven: as you may ſee here in the Tranſlation of <hi>Natalis Comes,</hi>

            <p>Theſe verſes have often made me doubt, whether or no, many of thoſe pretious ſtones that we ſee in Ancient Rings, which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly taken for <hi>Taliſmans,</hi> (ſuch as was that of our Countryman <hi>Bagarris,</hi> whereof I make mention:) on which we find <hi>Cupids, Bacchus,</hi> Vines, bunches of grapes, and vine-branches ingraven, were not rather the effects of ſome gallant Humor of ſome Philoſophers, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to weare on their fingers the Emblemes of Wine, rather then any other figures.</p>
            <p>In the ſame Sixth Chapter, where I ſpeake of the power of Reſemblance, I know not how, in the 172. page, the word, <hi>France,</hi> hath ſlipt in, inſtead of <hi>Italy.</hi> For it is in <hi>Italy</hi> chiefly, where the Leproſie is ſo frequent, by reaſon of the great quantity of Hogs fleſh that is eaten there, more then in any other
<pb facs="tcp:114719:12"/>Kingdome: and the reaſon that in <hi>France,</hi> we ſee ſome infected with this diſeaſe, is, becauſe that here, next to the <hi>Italians,</hi> they eate more hogs fleſh, then any where elſe. Neither do I ſay this, but according to the opinion of Phyſicians, without the leaſt purpoſe of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending any, either Strangers, or thoſe of my owne Nation. In a word, Courteous Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, I ſhall deſire thee to interpret in good part, whatſoever thou ſhalt find in this Book; ſeeing that my purpoſe is to deale clearely, as one exempt from paſſion.</p>
            <p>In the 77. page of the ſame Chapter, my intent is not to ranke <hi>Joſeph's</hi> gift of Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Dreames with the Art of Conjecturing at the meaning of <hi>Dreames:</hi> Nor yet to reject the order of the <hi>Commandements,</hi> eſtabliſhed by the Church, and to introduce that which is ſet downe, <hi>page</hi> 291. for I there follow the <hi>Jewes</hi> manner of counting them.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, I muſt intreat thee to correct the faults of the Preſſe; and uſe mee, as thou wouldſt be uſed thy ſelf.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. This nation is commonly abhorred for foure reaſons. The firſt is,<note place="margin">The 3. laſt Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chap,</note> their Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; which all Authors make them guilty of. The ſecond is, their fooliſh vanityes, that their books are full of. The third is, by reaſon of their blaſphemies, they to this day vomit up againſt our Saviour <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And the laſt is, for the errors that they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, contrary to the Law. The Firſt of theſe conceits is grounded on a falſe perſwaſion: for, after that it was once believed that the Jewes worſhiped the head of an Aſse, Hogs, and the Clouds; it was preſently concluded, that conſequently their writings could not be free from theſe impieties. The ſecond pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the little knowledge men gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally have of the bookes of the Jewes. The third, from the hatred men beare to the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:114719:23"/>Jewiſh Authors. And the fourth, from the Selfe conceitedneſs of thoſe that accuſe them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For the firſt of theſe Objections, <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion,</hi> as <hi>Joſephus</hi> affirmes, was the firſt, that forged it out of his owne braine: and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that this excellent Author of the Jewiſh Antiquities hath learnedly confuted him; Yet <hi>Plutarch</hi> takes it ſtill up for a Truth,<note place="margin">Symp. <hi>4.</hi> c. <hi>5.</hi> Hiſt. <hi>5.</hi>

Now this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the Jewes (ſay their Writers) was after this manner. There was an Altar e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected; under which having performed ſome certaine ceremonies, a Golden Statue of an Aſſe was ſet up upon it, (ſome make mention of the head onely) then, the chiefe Prieſt having cenſed it, all the People, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their hand to their mouth, bowed down and worſhiped it. The very ſame Adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in a manner, they uſed (as theſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors report) to the Statue of a Hog.</p>

                  <p>Sayes <hi>Petronius:</hi> as alſo to a Golden Vine; but with this difference, (ſayes <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarke,</hi> with <hi>Strabo, Trogus Pompeius,</hi> and <hi>Diodorus Siculus:</hi>) that the Prieſts, when
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:114719:23"/>they Sacrifiſed to <hi>Bacchus,</hi> were crowned with Jvy; and going with Flutes, and Drummes, ſounding before them, they bowed down before this Golden Tree, which was religiouſly preſerved within their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Concerning their worſhiping the Clouds, the opinions are divers: ſome af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming, that the Jewes had ſome Figures of them made in their places of Devotion: others ſay, not. But theſe are meere Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. So that, to make it appeare more clear then the Noon-day, that this Nation is no whit guilty of theſe Crimes; even <hi>Tacitus</hi> himſelfe, who had before accuſed them of Jdolatry, forgetting what he had ſaid before, addes preſently after, <hi>Nulla ſimulachra vrbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus ſuis, nedum templis eſſe:</hi> That they have no Images in their Cities, much leſſe in their Temples: So farre are they from worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Statues of a Hog, or Vine, or the figures of the Clouds.</p>

                  <p>But let us once teach the Ancients,<note place="margin">The firſt Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</note> ſince they have ſo often taught us; and pretend, forſooth, to have delivered nothing over to us but pure Truthes. If it be true, that the Jewes ſhould have given themſelves over to the vanities of worſhiping theſe Idols here ſpoken of: how comes it to paſſe, that their true God ſhould never, in all the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which he hath given them, lay this Crime to their charge as well as any other? And here we cannot ſay of This, as we uſe to ſay of our owne bookes: That a thing may have been, and yet not have been ſpoken of. For, in this Law, which all acknowledge to be moſt ſevere, the caſe is otherwiſe: For, in point of Crimes, not ſo much as the leaſt is omitted. Neither can any ſay, that Idolatry hath ſprung up ſince the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Old Teſtament: For, beſides that, the enemies of the Jewes would have then caſt it in their teeth, as moſt abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; The above named Authors affirme; that the Law forbidding them the eating of Hogs fleſh, had not been given them, but meerely becauſe they had worſhiped this Beaſt. But why then doe they not, by the ſame reaſon conclude, that this People had worſhiped Conies, Hares, Camels, Oſtridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and Ravens: Since the eating of theſe was alſo forbidden them?</p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:114719:24"/>
                  <p n="3">3. We ſay then, that theſe are meere ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies; or rather Fantaſtick Opinions, grounded upon the Jewes ſo religious ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining from the fleſh of this Beaſt; in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the Precept which was given them, for their better preſervation from the Leproſie; a diſeaſe they were otherwiſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſubject unto: and here you ſee the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of the Fable. As for the Golden Vine, and the Honours they are ſaid to have paid to <hi>Bacchus,</hi> I cannot diſcover, I confeſſe, in any Author, the riſe of this errour: and I conceive, the firſt that ſpake of this, might happily miſtake the name of the Jewes, for ſome other People; as we ſee it uſually hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in Authors, in the like caſe. Or elſe, ſome Apoſtate Jewes having been ſeen pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſing theſe acts of Idolatry, it was conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently concluded, that the whole Nation was guilty of the ſame.</p>
                  <p>But an account may more eaſily be given of the cauſe of the errour, in the buſineſſe of their worſhiping the Clouds; which might ſpring from that miraculous Cloud, which was light on one ſide, and darke on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and was guide to the Children of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell in the Wilderneſſe. Or perhaps this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſon which I ſhall now give, why the Jewes were called <hi>Coelicolae,</hi> Worſhipers of the Heavens, or the Clouds, may be more
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:114719:25"/>ſatisfying: Namely, becauſe they worſhiped God, who is often called in the Hebrew tongue, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </p>
                  <p>As for their being ſaid to worſhip the head of an Aſſe, thoſe that impute the beginning of this error to the great ſervice the Hebrewes had done them by Aſſes, at their comming up out of Egypt, ſeeme not at all to ſpeake with any probability. And yet <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſeemes to me much more ridiculous, when he ſaies, that the Jewes worſhiped Aſſes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, they found them out water in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe.<note place="margin">

I ſhould therefore rather ſay, that the affection which every man beares to his owne Religion, is ſo eager, and violent; that in all ages, upon all occaſions, thoſe of a contrary Beliefe have been very apt to fall fowle upon each other. The Jewes therefore, either for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:114719:25"/>been bound up by ſo many Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements; or elſe, for having been ſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient to their God, might have been called Aſſes: as <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth was wont to call the French, for being ſo tamely obedient to their Kings. And even the Primitive Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were not free from this very injury; for their common Epithete was, <hi>Aſinarij,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> reports; till the time of that Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, whoſe exceſſive hate againſt our Saviour <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> carried him on to that heigth of unparallel'd Malice, as that he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a ſtatue to be erected, bearing the ſhape of an Aſſe, houlding up a booke with one of his hoofes, with this inſcription on it: <hi>Deus Chriſtianorum Ononychitis.</hi>

                  <p n="4">4. Now the Jewes were the more readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believed guilty of all kindes of Idolatry, becauſe that, beſides that they had been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to have runne blindly after ſome ſorts of it, they dwelt alſo neare a People, that were very great Idolaters.

                  <p>But to ſhew the vanity of this Fable yet another way: I ſhall demand of theſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors above named, whence they have learnt, that the <hi>Syrians</hi> worſhipped Fiſhes, inſtead of Gods; and for that reaſon, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained from eating of them?

Her requeſt was granted; and ever ſince, the <hi>Syrians,</hi> whom Authors uſually confound with the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> have had Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and Doves, in great veneration.

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:114719:27"/>well, that the Fable might poſſibly have taken its originall from the Hiſtory: but where ſhall we find thoſe can witneſſe, that it did ſo? Whereas, on the other ſide, we know, that theſe. Fables are as ancient with the Greekes, as Aſtrology it ſelfe. We may therefore, from this very particular paſſage, conclude, what manner of ſpirit reigned in the writers of this Nation; whoſe delight it alwayes hath been, to put their fooliſh Fables upon the world, for Truths. And here I ſhall adventure to deliver, what I have ſometimes conceived, touching the ground of this Errour. <hi>Sidon,</hi> in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> who are <hi>Syrians,</hi> ſignifies <hi>a Fiſh,</hi> as <hi>Heurnius</hi> reports, after <hi>Juſtin.</hi> Now <hi>Sidon</hi> is a part of <hi>Syria,</hi>

                  <p n="5">5. This other Conjecture is not, in my judgment, very farre wide of the truth: namely, that the <hi>Syrians</hi> were accuſed of worſhipping Fiſhes, becauſe they worſhiped the Idol <hi>Dagon;</hi> which ſome have concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to have been halfe Fiſh, and halfe Man, in the forme of a <hi>Triton,</hi> or <hi>Syren:</hi> but with

This new King therefore comming to the Crown,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:114719:30"/>his ſubjects deſired to him the diminution of ſome certaine great impoſitions, which his Father (who could not in this deſerve the name of a wiſeman,) had charged them with. But they were ſo far from being relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as that they had heavier Taxes layd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; through the evill Counſell of the King, which is the readieſt cauſe of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of Kingdomes, and the beſt-groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Monarchies in the World.

                  <p>Now, one of the principall meanes that he made vſe of, was; that having conſidered with himſelfe, that there was nothing more likely to draw back the hearts of this people towards <hi>Rehoboam</hi> againe, than their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation which they were to have with the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:114719:30"/>Two Tribes, which continued at <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem:</hi> (for they were neceſſarily to appeare, three times in the year, before the Lord in <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi>) he reſolved with himſelfe, to eſtabliſh the ſame object of Adoration in <hi>Samaria,</hi> that was at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Now, in the Temple, there was the <hi>Arke,</hi> and the <hi>Cherubins,</hi> which <hi>Moſes</hi> had made, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Patterne which God had ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him in the Mount. <hi>Jeroboam</hi> therefore makes the ſame in <hi>Samaria;</hi> it not being neceſſary to make an Arke alſo: for you muſt note, the Arke was made, onely to hold the broken Tables of the Law; as you may ſee in <hi>Deuteronomy.</hi> But what?<note place="margin">Cap. <hi>10.</hi> V. <hi>5.</hi>
                     </note> you will ſay; were the Cherubins made by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> faſhioned like Calves, then? Yes, moſt certainly: ſince that thoſe which <hi>Jeroboam</hi> made, were but in imitation of them. And had they been of any other figure, he had then imitated that figure; and had not ſo much as dreamt of making Calves: ſeeing his purpoſe onely was, to retaine his people in their obedience, by the ſame forme of worſhip, that they uſed at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, how imprudent ſhould he have been, in going about to introduce a ſtrange Religion, which they had never before knowne?

Now, that the Cherubins, which <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> made to the Arke, were in the figure of Calves, that which <hi>Aaron</hi> made in the Wilderneſſe, at the intreaty of the children of Iſrael, proves ſufficiently: for doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe this High Prieſt did nothing, but what he conceived <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelfe would have done, had he been alive.

Now,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:114719:32"/>why he made this Cherubin in the ſhape of a <hi>Calf,</hi> rather then in any other of the three Figures, <hi>Abiudan,</hi> a Jew, ſpeaking of this particular, (a Manuſcript Copy of whoſe Workes Mr. <hi>Otho</hi> hath brought out of the Eaſt,) ſayes nothing at all. But <hi>Moncaeus,</hi> who hath likewiſe written of this Subject, gives the reaſon out of <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the <hi>Areopagite:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">In Vit. our. Cap. 5.</note> namely, that <hi>Aaron</hi> made choice of the Cherubin, that was figured like a Calfe; becauſe that being in the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance more abſurd, then any of the reſt, the Children of Iſrael would not be ſo apt to worſhip it. This Calfe therefore, or Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubin, was made by <hi>Aaron;</hi> not as if he had firſt caſt the gold in a rude Maſſe, and then afterwards ſhaped it, working it in the ſame manner, as Statuaries doe, in rude Stones: as <hi>Moncaeus</hi> is of opinion. Nor yet, that this Calfe came out by chance, without any purpoſed deſigne of <hi>Aaron,</hi> in making it in ſhape like a Calfe: as moſt of the Ancients have been bold to affirme: But having firſt made a Mould, <hi>Et projeci illud (aurum) in fornacem, egreſſuſque eſt hic Vitulus:</hi> he caſt the gold into it, and there came forth this Calfe. If the People afterwards provoked God to wrath thereby, it was not for making the Calfe, but for worſhipping it. For as <hi>Martiall</hi> ſayes,</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>Neither doe we any where read, that <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> was at all reproved of God, for having made it.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. So that the concluſion, which we may draw from hence, is; that the Cherubins which were on the Arke, were really made in the ſhape of Calves: and that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this Doctrine, <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> in imitating them, could not in any wiſe be counted an Idolater, but onely a Schiſmatick, or Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiſt from the worſhip, that was performed in <hi>Jernſalem:</hi> notwithſtanding that the ſame befell him, that had happened to <hi>Aaron</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him; namely, that though His Purpoſe was good, yet nevertheleſſe there were among the People, that worſhipped them: and this is the reaſon, they are reproved by God. Now that hee had no intention at all to ſet up Idolatry, by this Act, appeares clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this; that the Kings his Succeſſors, who all were of the ſame Beliefe, are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny where reproved for this crime, untill the Reigne of wicked <hi>Achab,</hi> who was ſeduced by his wife <hi>Jezabell,</hi> the moſt Imperious woman that ever was.

And how <hi>Aſa</hi> in like manner, King of <hi>Samaria,</hi> could have walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the wayes of <hi>David,</hi> if he had beene tainted with this horrible Crime? <hi>Et fecit Aſa rectum ante conſpectum Domini, ſicut Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid pater ejus:</hi> and yet notwithſtanding, <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celſa non abſtulit,</hi> He took not away the High places, that is to ſay, <hi>Vitulos,</hi> the Calves. As if the Author of the holy Scriptureshad purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to prevent the Objection which is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally made, concerning the erecting of theſe Calves to an evill End: for theſe words ſeeme to have been ſet downe ſo expreſly, meerly for the confutation of thoſe men that are wedded to their owne wills, and for the clearing of the truth of that, which I have here delivered: <hi>Cor Aſa perfectum fuit cum Domino, etſi Excelſa non abſtulerit.</hi> Which is an Infallible Argument, that they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in theſe Calves, or Cherubins, the ſame which they of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> did in thoſe of the Arke; namely, the preſence of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:114719:33"/>God, ſitting there, as on his Throne; notwithſtanding that many, out of ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, worſhipped the bare figure of this <hi>Work of Mens</hi> hands: And this is that, which God ſo often complaines of. As if this were the Literall meaning of this Paſſage; to wit: that the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had indeed done that which was right in the ſight of God, and had lived according to his Lawes: yet, that they might have done better, if they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away theſe Cherubins, which were the cauſe of the deſtruction of many, who made other uſe of them, then that for which they were intended. I remember to have read ſomewhere to this purpoſe, of a Biſhop of <hi>Marſeille;</hi> who ſeeing, that many of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple behaved themſelves toward the Images, that are uſually placed in Churches, with ſo great reſpect, as that one day he obſerved ſome of their actions that came within the compaſſe of Idolatry; he cauſed them all to be broken to pieces, leaving only a very few in ſome certain places of his Dioceſs: So true it is, that we often abuſe thoſe things, which were inſtituted only to good ends. I ſhall only adde one word more, for the defending of the Innocence of the <hi>Samaritans;</hi> which is: that, when <hi>Salmonazar</hi> had ranſacked their Country, he ſent into it Colonies out of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia;</hi> who falling to commit Idolatry, as they
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:114719:34"/>had uſed to doe in their own Country; God ſent Lions among them, to deſtroy them. For remedy of which calamity,<note place="margin">4 <hi>Reg.</hi> 17</note> they could finde out no better expedient, then to ſend for one of the Jewiſh Prieſts, whom they had lead away captives, for to inſtruct theſe Idolaters in the Worſhip of the true God; which being done, they were freed from that calamity: which is a certaine Argument, ſaith <hi>Abiudan,</hi> that all the <hi>Samaritans</hi> were not Idolaters. This obſervation of <hi>Abiudan, Moncaeus</hi> takes no notice of; yet He hath alſo an Obſervation, which <hi>Abiudan</hi> paſſes by; (out of the hate, I conceave, that he bare to the True <hi>Meſsias,</hi> and becauſe that the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony made againſt himſelfe;) namely, that when our Saviour <hi>Chriſt</hi> uttered the Story, or Parable of the Travailer, that fell among Theeves, the <hi>Samaritan</hi> is there ſaid to have had more pity on him, then the Prieſt of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> I ſhall adde here, that the ſame God, being become Man, did not at all deny himſelfe to be a <hi>Samaritan,</hi> when he was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſo by way of reproach: which doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he would have done, if he had knowne this people to be wholy Idolatrous.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. But now, in the progreſſe of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, the Curious Critick, who uſes to leave nothing unſifted, may happily propoſe this Queſtion to me. If the Cherubins of the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:114719:34"/>Arke were made in the forme of Calves; what ſhould move almoſt all Writers to maintaine, that they were in ſhape like young Boyes? I confeſſe, I could willingly have put off the anſwering this Queſtion (which neither <hi>Abiudan,</hi> nor <hi>Moncaeus,</hi> have taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny notice of, or elſe have purpoſely paſſed it by,) to ſome other time: But ſeeing that I write to the Learned, it concernes me wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly to omit nothing, that makes for my ſubject; that ſo I be not ranked in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoſe men, that when they write of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny argument, doe voluntarily ſlip over the choyceſt things in it. I ſay then, in two words, and without making any long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe on it, (ſince that I handle this very Queſtion in another place,) that all the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, both Greek, and Latine, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of the Jewiſh too, as <hi>Aben-Ezra, Scelomoh,</hi> and the <hi>Talmudiſts,</hi> who have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed the forme of young Boyes to theſe Cherubins, have done it upon ſuch weake grounds; that we need but onely to rehearſe them, to ſhew their inſufficiency.

Now every body knowes, that the greateſt part of theſe books teach the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity of Gods; and ſome of them, Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry alſo: But as for thoſe of the Jewes, who is he, that hath ever accuſed them of either of theſe Crimes; or that found any other Doctrine taught in them, then that of the True God? And why then may not men of Learning read theſe, ſince we permit the other to be read to raw Children, that are apt to believe any thing? If there be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Fooleries to be found in them; as it is objected by thoſe, that never read them; there is yet much leſſe danger in Theſe, then in Apoſtacy: neither is there any of them ſo Abſurd, but that ſome Good thing may

And when all is done, the neareſt that a man ſhall be able to come to the Truth, will perhaps be about Twenty five, or Thirty yeares, over, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and no otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p n="8">8.<note place="margin">The 3. Object.</note> The third Objection, brought by thoſe, that will not admit the Jewes bookes to be read, ſeemes to have more Reaſon in it, then all the reſt. For, if they be indeed full of ſcoffings againſt the Life of Him, who hath given Us Ours; if they accuſe his Actions, deteſt his Doctrine, and condemne his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, as ignominious; in a word, if they are full of nothing but Blaſphemies againſt <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who is he that could endure to read them? And here <hi>Sixtus Senenſis</hi> tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs over his Enemies, and reckons up all the Impieties the Iſraelites were ever guilty of; and there is ſcarcely any one kind of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, or villany, that he layes not to their charge. In a word, he numbers up, as well all the erroneous points of their Beliefe, as their Reproachfull ſpeeches which they vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:114719:46"/>up againſt the Sonne of God: ſo that one that had not read their bookes, and knowne the Truth of the buſineſſe, would judge them to have been written rather by Divels, then by Men. But this Author,<note place="margin">The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</note> (who had not written againſt this Nation, but, as almoſt all others have done, meerely out of the hatred is generally borne, toward theſe <hi>Deicides,</hi>) thought peradventure, that after the burning ſo many Jewiſh Libraries in <hi>Italy,</hi> and after that himſelfe had beene an Eye-witneſſe of Twelve Thouſand Volumes burnt to Aſhes at <hi>Cremona,</hi> he thought, I ſay, that after ſo rigorous an Inquiſition, there could have been no more books left, by which wee might have been able to ſatisfie our ſelves, in the Truth of thoſe things that are objected againſt the Jewes. But he had forgot to burne the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of <hi>Galatinus</hi> too, or rather of <hi>Sebondus:</hi> (for I ſhall make it appeare in another place, that <hi>Galatine</hi> was never the Author of that Learned Booke, intituled, <hi>de Arcanis Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licae ſidei:</hi>) He had, I ſay, forgot to burne theſe Learned writings too, which doe make it clearely appeare, that the greateſt part of thoſe things that are written in this Particular, is falſe; and prove, that the Blaſphemies, which the Ancient Rabbins uttered againſt <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> were not meant at all of <hi>Chriſt, our Redeemer,</hi> but of another <hi>Jeſus,</hi> very far
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:114719:47"/>different from Ours. And this is ſo known a Truth, that the moſt furious among the Iewes dare not deny it, unleſſe they deny their <hi>Talmud.</hi> So that this Confeſſion being ſo much the more forcible, becauſe it proceeds from the mouth of our Adverſaries; it quite overthrowes all that <hi>Senenſis,</hi> and thoſe of his Perſwaſion, have brought to the contrary. I will not ſay, but that the Later Rabbins doe more perverſely handle the Controverſy, which is betwixt Them and Us; namely, Whether <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> be the true <hi>Meſsias,</hi> or not: and that, among the Heats of ſo weighty a Diſpute, they doe ſometimes ſpeake irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently of our ſacred Myſteries: But, (which is a very wonderfull thing, and which ought to convince all the enemies to the writings of theſe men;) among ſo great a number of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments that are brought againſt us, by <hi>R. David Kimchi,</hi> and <hi>R. Joſeph Alboni,</hi> (two Iewiſh Rabbins, which were both very lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and very zealous for their owne Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:) you ſhall not find one Opprobrious ſpeech uttered againſt <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> as that he was a ſeditious perſon, (as he was called in his life time,) or a Magician, or an Impoſtor, or a Malefactor, or any other the like Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous termes: notwithſtanding there is ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any of our Chriſtian Writers, that have written againſt the Iewes, which give them
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:114719:47"/>not very hard language. They diſpute indeed, Whether the Goſpel be a Law, or not: but not, Whether the Author of it were a Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Man, or no. Nay, on the contrary, they rather confeſſe him to have religiouſly kept all the Commandements of the <hi>Decalogue.</hi> They ſay indeed, that he was but meere Man, and not God: being blinded by the Confeſſion, which this God of Love made of himſelfe: <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go ſum vermis, &amp; non homo:</hi> but they doe not ſay, that he was a Wicked, Perfidious Perſon. They accuſe his Apoſtles indeed of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, but not of Falſehood: as, when S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that the Iſraelites demanded a King of <hi>Samuel;</hi> who gave them the ſonne of <hi>Cis,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about the age of forty years; whereas the Scripture ſeemes to ſay otherwiſe. As alſo, when Saint <hi>Stephen</hi> ſaid, that thoſe that went downe with <hi>Jacob</hi> into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> were ſeventy five ſoules in number; whereas in <hi>Geneſis</hi> it is ſaid, they were but ſeventy in all. And ſo likewiſe in diverſe other Paſſages, which have been, long ſince, often reconciled, and cleared of Errour. They deny indeed, that in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, a Great Body, with all its parts, can poſſibly be in ſo ſmall a Morſell: but they doe not ſay, that the Inſtitution, and uſe of it in the Chriſtian Church, is Diabolicall, as the Hereticks ſay. In a word, they deny indeed, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is the true <hi>Meſsias;</hi> but the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:114719:48"/>doe not ſay, that his Doctrine is againſt God. Thoſe that deſire to be more fully ſatisfied in this Controverſie, may have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to a Tract, written by <hi>Genebrard,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe two Learned Jewes above na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. To conclude then, both againſt <hi>Senen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi> and all of his Opinion; I affirme, that the Ancient Rabbins are ſo farre from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching our <hi>Saviour Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as that, on the contrary, they allow of his Doctrine, and confirme the Hiſtory, which is delivered us: as I doe clearly prove, in my <hi>Advertiſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment aux Doctes, touchant la neceſsite des lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues Orientales,</hi> which I ſhall, God willing, put forth very ſhortly.</p>
                  <p n="9">9.<note place="margin">The 4. Object.</note> I come now to the laſt objection, which is: that the Bookes of the Rabbines erre, in the Interpretation of the Law: and that being full of Vaine, and ridiculous, Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, and ſome that are dangerous too; they ought not to be read by Chriſtians, who are to ſeeke after nothing, but the true Traditions of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and his Church.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall not take upon me to anſwer fully, and in every particular, to this Objection: ſince that it cannot be denied, but that the Rabbins doe erre ſometimes, and that their Interpretations are ſometimes wide enough of the matrer. But that therefore they muſt preſently be burnt, or not read at all, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:114719:48"/>all Sence, or Reaſon: for, otherwiſe, we were to proceed in the ſame manner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our ſelves, and muſt condemne our owne bookes alſo; which are ſcarcely to be found, any of them, without their Errors: I ſpeake even of thoſe very bookes, that are of higheſt eſteeme, and uſe, among us. So that if theſe muſt all be committed to the Flame, we ſhould ſpeedily ſee-o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

For, who knowes not, that the works of <hi>Tertullian</hi> favour the Sect of the <hi>Montaniſts,</hi> where he ſpeaks of a new <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clet,</hi> and a new Propheſie; as alſo, where he condemnes <hi>Second Marriages?</hi> If we but diligently peruſe the Writings of all the reſt of the Fathers, we ſhall find, that thoſe of St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> maintain the Rebaptizing of ſuch, as having abjured their Hereſie, had been formerly baptized by Hereticks What Error is it, that the writings of the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Origen</hi> are not polluted with? If any man out of Curioſity deſire to ſee a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of them, he may have recourſe to the Learned Epiſtle of St. <hi>Jerome, ad Avi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</hi> Doth not St. <hi>Hilary</hi> ſeem to detract much from the merits of our <hi>Saviour Chriſt,</hi> when he maintaines, that his Sacred Body was not at all capable of Suffering; and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:114719:49"/>that Hunger, Thirſt, Wearineſſe, and the reſt of Humane Infirmities, were not Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall in him, but as the Schoole ſpeaks, <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptae?</hi> Neither did <hi>Epiphanius</hi> fall into leſs Errors then theſe, when he writes, upon thoſe words of Chriſt, <hi>Pater Major me eſt,</hi> that it was true alſo of his Divine Nature; and that, in the garden of Olives, he ſpake not theſe words ſeriouſly; <hi>Pater, ſi fieri poteſt, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeat à me Calix iſte;</hi> but onely by way of Diſſimulation, to deceive the Devill. I paſſe by many things delivered by him, touching the death of our <hi>Saviour Chriſt,</hi> which the purity of Divinity cannot allow of: as alſo, when in his diſputation againſt <hi>Aerius,</hi> he affirmes, that one of the Precepts left by the Apoſtles, was, that, during the ſix daies immediately before the Paſſeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer, we muſt eat nothing but Bread, with Salt. St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> alſo, in his Allegories, in which he exceeds, is not alwayes blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe: for ſometimes he lets fall ſuch things, as are quite contradicting the ſenſe of the Holy Scriptures. As, for example, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of St. <hi>Peter's</hi> ſinne, he holds, that this Apoſtle denied not <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> as God, but onely as Man: as likewiſe, when he makes it Lawfull for a man, that hath put away his Wife by Divorce, to marry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother woman, provided, ſhe alſo had not
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:114719:49"/>been divorced. St. <hi>Jerome</hi> runs as farre into the other Extreame; for, pleading for Virginity, againſt <hi>Jovinian,</hi> he doth ſo cry out againſt Marriage, that he makes it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt a ſinne to marry: and goes on ſo far, as to account Second Marriages to be no other then meere Fornication, and a Trade of Bawdery. St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo had his many Errours: As, when he maintaines, that the Euchariſt ought to be adminiſtred to little Children; and that, if they dye without Baptiſme, they are Damned. You may find many other Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors in the Writings of this Learned Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: But they are ſuch, as we may truly call, <hi>Happy ones;</hi> ſince that they gave oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to the writing of that Excellent Book of his <hi>Retractations;</hi> without which, a great part of the Learning of this moſt Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Father, had been concealed from us. I could proceed to reckon up ſome Errors of each of the reſt of the Fathers, both Greek and Latine, for the proving of my Aſſertion: namely, that we have the ſame reaſon to forbeare the reading of them, that we have againſt the books of the Rabbins: ſo that, we ſhould at length be reduced to this extremity, of having no other books, but only the Holy Scriptures. And yet neither could theſe paſſe, if we ſhould reſt only on
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:114719:50"/>the Bare Letter; ſince there are ſome things found there, that ſeem contrary to Truth. Thus <hi>Cajetan</hi> hath obſerved,<note place="margin">

                     </note> which is written in <hi>Malachi:</hi> and ſo likewiſe, when he ſayes, our Saviour Chriſt was Crucified on the Third houre; ſeeing that St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, that he was but only condemned by <hi>Pilat,</hi> the Sixth houre.<note place="margin">Ioan. <hi>19.</hi>

                     </note> and <hi>Salec,</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Cainan,</hi> he contradicts the place in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> where it is ſaid, that <hi>Salec</hi> was not <hi>Arphaxad's</hi> Grandſonne, but his Sonne, no other Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration intervening betwixt theſe two. And when he ſayes alſo, that the Cave, which <hi>Abraham</hi> bought, was in <hi>Sichem;</hi> which was indeed in <hi>Hebron:</hi>

                     </note> and that he bought it of the Sons of <hi>Emor,</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Sichem:</hi> whereas <hi>Moſes</hi> ſayes, it was, of <hi>Ephron</hi> the <hi>Hittite.</hi> And ſo likewiſe, when he ſayes, that <hi>Emor</hi> was <hi>Sichem's</hi> Sonne, when as it is ſaid in <hi>Geneſis,</hi>

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:114719:50"/>that <hi>Emor</hi> was <hi>Sichem's</hi> Father, and not his Sonne. I ſhall not here undertake to juſtifie all theſe Paſſages: many great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages, of former Ages, have already done it very happily: ſo that we cannot any longer, without manifeſt Injury, ſay, that there is any Errour at all in them. As for the Errors of the Fathers, I ſhould rather think charitably of them, and ſay; that, as St. <hi>Jerome</hi> complained in his Time,<note place="margin">Ep. ad Pammac. &amp; Ocean.</note> that the Writings of <hi>Origen</hi> had been cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by ſome Impoſtor; as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> likewiſe complaines, in thoſe of St. <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an:</hi> ſo poſſibly, thoſe of the other Fathers may have beene corrupted too. But this Excuſe, which my Charity hath ſuggeſted to me, hinders not, but that we are to reject Their workes, ſuch as now we have them, if we are not to read any of thoſe, that have erred.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is nothing in the whole buſineſſe of Learning, which aſtoniſhes mee more, then to ſee, how many of the moſt Excellent Wits of this our Age, make it their buſineſſe, to find fault with the Ancients, and to load them with injurious ſpeeches: as if this evill cuſtom had now grown into a Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ime with them, that one can never paſſe for an Able man, nor appeare to be Any Body,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:114719:52"/>without reprehending thoſe which have gone before us, and from whoſe Learned writings we have derived the moſt Curious, and Choyſe Points of Knowledge that we have. The <hi>Perſians,</hi> or, if you pleaſe, the <hi>Babyloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> that bordered upon the River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> were the Firſt, as Rabbins report, that found out the ſecret power of Figures. The won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that have been effected by them, have been acknowledged by all the Ancients, and approved of throughout all <hi>Aegypt:</hi> in ſo much that, thoſe, who were the firſt that have written of them, have maintained, that there was not any thing of more Excellency, and Admiration, within the compaſſe of the whole Univerſe: Theſe firſt Writers have been ſeconded by all thoſe that have come af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them; even down to Our owne Daies, and the Daies of our Fathers; wherein we have at length ſeen this Secret condemned, and the <hi>Perſians</hi> accuſed of Sorcery: ſo that, to the end I may free from ſuſpicion, whatſoever I ſhall borrow from Themm, it will concern me to ſhew Their Innocence here, as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready done for the <hi>Jewes</hi> their Neighbours: and ſhall ground my Defence of them, upon what I have found written, in the Preface of a certaine <hi>Perſian Aſtrologer,</hi> tranſlated into Hebrew by Rabbi <hi>Chomer,</hi> a Modern Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor: and I ſhall adde to his Reaſons, what
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:114719:52"/>other I ſhall be able to find, among the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of both Greeks, and Latines, to render them the more powerfull.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>Curioſities</hi> therefore of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> that is to ſay, their <hi>Figures,</hi> and <hi>Magicke,</hi> are uſually condemned, for foure Reaſons. The firſt is, becauſe they are ſaid to have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from the moſt Wicked perſon, next to <hi>Cain,</hi> that ever was; that is, from <hi>Cham,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwie called <hi>Zoroaſter.</hi> The ſecond is, becauſe the Learned men of this Nation ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged no other Deity, ſave that of the Heavens, and the Stars; and, by conſequence, their Doctrine muſt therefore neceſſarily be very Dangerous. The third is, that they teach the worſhipping of Spirits, or Divels, that convey themſelves into Statues. The fourth is, that they made certain Figures, and Images, from whence they received Benefits of all ſorts, by the uſe of Witchcrafts, and Inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>To the Firſt of Theſe, <hi>Hamahalzel,</hi> the Author of the Aſtrology above-named, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers in one word, and ſaies; that the conſtant and unanimous tradition in <hi>Perſia,</hi> is, that <hi>Zoroaſter</hi> was ſo Good a Man, that the moſt Religious ſort of people of that Country are daily converſant in the reading of a Pious Tract, that is ſaid to have been of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing; the Title whereof is, <hi>Memlecheti Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laal,</hi>
                     <pb n="64" facs="tcp:114719:53"/>that is to ſay, <hi>The Kingdome of God.</hi> But ſuppoſe, he was not the Author of this Book; it is very falſe however,<note place="margin">Vid.

And that this is not the True <hi>Beroſus,</hi> and therefore not to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, beſides many other reaſons that are brought to confirme it, this following is none of he worſt; namely, that he makes Mention as well of the <hi>Libyans, Almans,</hi> and <hi>Italians,</hi> as of the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi>

This Forgery of <hi>Annius</hi> hath alſo lead <hi>Genebrard,</hi> and <hi>Comeſtor,</hi> into the ſame errour, of believing <hi>Zoroaſter</hi> to be the ſame, that <hi>Cham. Georgius Venetus</hi> likewiſe, and <hi>Pierius</hi> wrong themſelves very much, in maintaining, that he was no other, then the ſon
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:114719:53"/>of <hi>Cham,</hi> and Grand-ſonne to <hi>Noah,</hi> and the ſame that is called in the holy Scriptures, <hi>Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raim.</hi> And indeed if it were ſo, how comes it to paſſe, that <hi>Pliny,</hi> ſpeaking ſo often of him, makes no mention of it at all? Hee ſaies indeed, that the ſame day he came into the world, he laughed; and that his Braines beate ſo ſtrongly, that if any laid their hand upon his head, this motion ſtruck it back againe at the ſame inſtant: which was, ſaith he, a ſign, that he would be a very Knowing man. but that he was either <hi>Cham,</hi> or the ſonne of <hi>Cham,</hi> is more then <hi>Pliny</hi> had ever met with: and with him concurre-in opinion, the two <hi>Juſtins,</hi> St. <hi>Auguſtine, Epiphanius,</hi> and in a manner all the Fathers, that have made any mention of him. But ſuppoſe him, may ſome one ſay, to have been neither <hi>Cham,</hi> nor the ſonne of <hi>Cham;</hi> yet it cannot be denied, but that hee was a Magician, and a Sorcerer. If <hi>Naudae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> had not already Learnedly anſwered this Objection, I ſhould in this place have exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined it: but I ſhall now deſire the Reader to ſee the Reaſons he hath ſet downe,<note place="margin">Cap. <hi>8.</hi>

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:114719:54"/>to prove it, after a ridiculous manner. <hi>Dinon,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in quinto Hiſtoriarum libro,</hi> Zoroaſtrem, <hi>ex interpretatione nominis ſui, Aſtrorum aſſerit fuiſse cultorem.</hi> I have tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned over the Perſian Dictionary, with all poſſible diligence; and yet could not meet, neither with this word, nor any like it, that can ſignifie that which <hi>Dinon</hi> would have.

For, ſpeaking of the Story mentioned in the 17. of <hi>Judges,</hi> he ſayes: that <hi>Micah</hi> made, of fine gold, and Silver, three Images of young Lads, and three Calves, and one Lion, one Dragon, and one Dove: So that if any one had a minde to know any ſecret concerning his Wife, he was to have recourſe to the Image of the Dove, which anſwered his demands: if concerning his children, he went to the Boyes: if concerning Riches, to the Eagle: if concerning power and ſtrength, to the Lion: if it any thing concerned ſonnes, or
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:114719:57"/>Daughters, he went then to the Calves: and if it were about Length of Yeares, and Daies, he was to conſult the Image of the Dragon. A very pretty Fiction, in truth.

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:114719:58"/>is ſo, appeares by this; that though this bleſſed Patriarch had beene ſo long a time ſojourning in this Country; yet he never made any mention at all of Falſe Gods, till the time of this Pillaging of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naaites, who were a People given to all manner of Idolatry: which was the reaſon, (ſay the moſt Learned of the <hi>Rabbins,</hi>) that <hi>Abraham</hi> made his Servant ſweare unto him, not to take a Wife for his Sonne <hi>Iſaack</hi> out of This People: <hi>Adjuro te</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>per Dominum Coeli &amp; Terrae, ut non accipias Uxorem filio meo de filiabus Chananaeorum:</hi> becauſe he knew that they were Idolaters. The ſame Charge did <hi>Iſaack</hi> give his Son <hi>Jacob. Hamahalzel</hi> therefore concludes with this Truth; that certainly, in the time of theſe Patriarchs, there were ſome certaine wonderfull Images, or Statues, by which God made known his Will to his People. Thoſe that ſhall have the happineſſe to ſee the Tract, which <hi>MOnacaeus</hi> ſaies, he hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of this Subject; will be ready to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that they are not Dreames, which are here delivered by this <hi>Perſian</hi> Author of ours. If it be demanded; why then did not <hi>Moes</hi> make a particular deſcription of thee Images? I anſwer, tha this Wife Law-giver, knowing how extreamly incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to Idolatry, the People, which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:114719:58"/>was; makes no other mention of them, ſave only in paſſage: being unwilling to forget them wholy, leſt any thing of the Hiſtory ſhould have been left out.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. I doe the more boldly propoſe this Doctrine, after this Perſian Writer; becauſe I ſee, that in all Ages, God hath made known his Wonders, and what ever Accident of Importance was to happen, throughout the Univerſe, by ſome Senſible thing; and will yet doe the ſame hereafter, when he ſhall come to judge the Quick and the Dead; giving a Signe of his Comming, by the Falling of the Stars, and the Darkening of the Sun and Moon, and by a Deep Aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment caſt upon all Mortals. If you pleaſe but to look back upon all Ages paſt, you ſhall not find any one, (where accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this Truth) ſome new Prodigie did not foreſhew the Good, or the Evill Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, that were to come. Thus we ſee, that a little before the time that <hi>Xerxes</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the Earth, with his Million of men, there appeared horrible and dreadfull Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teors, as Preſages of the Evils that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward happened: as there did likewiſe in the time of <hi>Attila,</hi> who was called <hi>Flagellum Dei.</hi> And, to goe higher, was not poore <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> forewarned of her Approaching Miſerie, which made her the moſt wretched
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:114719:59"/>of all Cities, by many the like Prodigies? For there was often ſeen, in the Aire, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of men in battell array, ſeeming to be ready to charge each other: and one day, at the Feaſt of Pentecoſt, the High Prieſt entring into the Temple, to offer the Uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Sacrifices, which God regarded now no more; there was heard a Suddaine Noiſe, and a Voice immediately following it, which ſaid: <gap reason="foreign">

My mother, <hi>Lucrece de Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> when ſhee was living, had ſome ſuch ſigne alwaies given her: for there never dyed any of our Kindred, but, a little before, ſhee dreamt either of Haire, or of Egges, or of Teeth, all mingled together with Earth; and this ſigne was an infallible one: and I my ſelfe, when I had heard her ſay ſhe had any ſuch Dreame, obſerved the Event alwayes to follow.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. My purpoſe is not to make this Volume ſwell, by reckoning up all theſe examples: one only of them would have been ſufficient<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the Learned, to have confirmed the Truth of what I have delivered: and in adding more, I doe it but the more powerfully to enforce the Induction, upon the ſpirits of thoſe Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate Men, that will hardly be induced to the beliefe of the truth of this my Aſſertion. I ſhall therefore draw this Concluſion, from all that which I before delivered; that, ſeeing, that God hath formerly Miraculouſly fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhewed,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:114719:61"/>and doth ſtill, at this very day, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhew, by diverſe ſignes, and in very many things, what Events ſhall follow: he may then as well have ſhewed it heretofore, by One only, Particular Meanes: ſuch, perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, as was that of <hi>Laban's</hi> Images, which wee may probably gueſſe, to have been the <hi>Teraphim,</hi> ſpoken of by <hi>Hoſea.</hi> And then, if the Ancient <hi>Perſians,</hi> as <hi>Zoroaſter,</hi>

                  <p>The Laſt Reaſon, for which the Perſian Magicians are condemned, is thus anſwered by <hi>Hamahalzel.

For, who would ever have thought, that beſides
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:114719:70"/>thoſe many Wonders, which have been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to be in the Load-ſtone, but in the daies of our Grandfathers, there ſhould yet in Our Time alſo be found out This, in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine kind of Load-ſtone, which is of a Mixt Colour, betwixt white and blacke, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing reſembling that of Iron; that, if a Knife, or Needle be touched with it, it will cut, and enter into a man's body, without the leaſt ſenſe of paine at all? Which hath given occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to a very Learned man, who himſelfe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo had tried the Experiment, to ſay; that our Mountebanks,<note place="margin">Card. de ſubtil. l. <hi>6.7.</hi>
                     </note> which we ſee to cut, and flaſh themſelves upon their Stages in ſuch manner, without the leaſt change of countenance, doe make uſe of this Experiment. But my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe here is not, to ſet downe indifferently, what ever wonderfull effects there are found, in Stones, and in Plants: Their ſeverall Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, the power whereof we now undertake, is the only ſubject, which at preſent I have propoſed to my ſelfe. It is neceſſary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for the avoyding of all Equivocation, that I make a Diviſion of theſe Figures; their Generall name being already known.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They are therefore either Naturall, Accidentall, or Artificiall: of which, this Laſt ſort ſhall be the ſubject of the Enſuing Chapter, and the two Former Kinds, of This. Now, both the Naturall, and Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:114719:70"/>as they are of three ſorts; that is, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſſed, or riſing up; hollowed, or Naturally ingraven; and only Painted: ſo are they found alſo in three ſorts of things; namely, in Stones chiefely, in Plants, and in Living Creatures: which neither <hi>Albertus,</hi> nor <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millus</hi> have obſerved. Now there is this Difference betwixt the Naturall, and the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentall: that theſe Later (ſay Writers) are not made to any End Propoſed; whereas, on the Contrary, thoſe other are never produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced without ſome Reaſon, or other. The Accidental are produced after ſome ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as was that Act of the Painter; who, being not able to expreſſe, to his mind, the Foaming of a Horſe, in a fury threw his Spung at his Piece, with a purpoſe utterly to deface it: but it ſo happened, that, what his Pencill could not doe, his Spunge performed ſo rarely, that it was impoſſible for any hand to mend it. This Foame then was made, without any Intention of the Painter to make it. But if I ſhould ſay, there is no ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in the Works of Nature; I ſhould ſay nothing, but what were Juſtifiable. For, if we are taught even by Divinity it ſelfe, and Reaſon alſo confirmes it; that there is a Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Providence, which leads on all things to their End; and which makes nothing, but to ſome purpoſe: why ſhould we then aſcribe to
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:114719:71"/>Fortune, any thing that cauſeth us to admire the Power of God; and, to impute to Chance, things that are of greateſt Admiration? ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that, among ſo many Leaves that are found in a Foreſt, there is not one of them falls, without the Will and Pleaſure of Him, that created them. But ſuppoſe we ſhould admit, that there are ſome Figures Acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall: we ſhall notwithſtanding endeavour to prove the power of a good number of ſuch, as muſt needs be confeſt to be Naturall. Let us now in Order conſider, both the one, and the other.</p>
                  <p>We have already ſaid, that they are found in three ſorts of things; in Stones, in Plants, and in Living Creatures. Thoſe that are found in Stones, are called <hi>Gamahes;</hi> a word derived, in my opinion, from <hi>Camaïeu;</hi> by which name, in <hi>France,</hi> they call all Figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Agats:</hi> ſo that from this Particular name, there is now made a Generall Appellation, ſerving to expreſſe all ſorts of Figured Stones. To give an account now of this word, and to tell whence it is Originally deſcended, is ſomething a difficult thing: no one Author that I have met with, having reſolved this Doubt, or indeed ſo much as propoſed it: only this one thing I do aſſuredly know, that it is no <hi>French</hi> word, but a Stranger. And I have ſometimes thought; that, as the Jewes,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:114719:71"/>who lived a long time in <hi>France,</hi> have left us many of their Words; (as I prove elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where:)<note place="margin">Advis ſur les Langues.</note> they might peradventure have left us this alſo: and this Conjecture ſeemes the more probable, in that this People tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficks much in precious Stones.

Thus, ſpeaking of a pleaſant Garden, it calls it, <hi>Paradiſus Domini:</hi> of a great Army, <hi>Exercitus Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni:</hi> of tall Cedars, <hi>Cedri Dei:</hi> of high Mountaines, <hi>Montes Dei:</hi> and ſo of the reſt. The Figures then, which are repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented on Stones, are, as we have formerly ſaid, of Three ſorts alſo: either Painted, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſſed, or Ingraven.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Paitned ones are of two ſorts; either Coloured, or without Colour: the Coloured, are all ſuch as are found on <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats;</hi> ſuch as was that of King <hi>pyrrhus,</hi> where the Nine <hi>Muſes,</hi> richly apparrelled, were repreſented dancing, with <hi>Apollo</hi> in the

                     </note> by meere Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent: but rather is of opinion, that it was made after this manner. Some Painter, (ſaies he) had, long before, pictured, upon a piece of Marble, <hi>Apollo</hi> amidſt the <hi>Muſes,</hi> and afterward, either by Chance, or upon ſet Purpoſe, this Picture being buried in the ground, in ſome place where <hi>Agates</hi> were generated; the Marble was turned into Agate, and yet ſtill retained the very ſame Lineaments, which had beene formerly drawne upon it.

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:114719:72"/>which was afterwards converted into Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; which is very ridiculous: or ſuppoſe, that this was not ſome other Stone turned into Marble; but that it had, by ſome Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Meanes, only received, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Figure of ſome Crucifixe, which had been applied unto it: We muſt then be forced neceſſarily to ſay, that all other Stones have received thoſe Figures, which we ſee perfectly repreſented upon them, by the like Application: which Opinion is farre wider of Common Senſe, then the Former. <hi>M. de Breves</hi> either had not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, or elſe had forgot to ſpeake of that other <hi>Gamahe,</hi> or Wonderfull Figure, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Naturall, which is to be ſeen in the ſame Church, upon an Altar of Jaſper-coloured Marble. This Figure is a Death's Head, ſo exactly drawne, that you cannot find a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny part of it defective. How prodigiouſly full of Wonder the Effects of Nature are, which ſhewes her ſelfe Admirable in all her waies!</p>
                  <p>And here we are to take notice, that theſe Figures are more frequently found, toward the Eaſtern, and the Southern Countries, then in any other; by reaſon of the Heat,<note place="margin">Tract. <hi>3.</hi> cap. <hi>4.</hi>

There was likewiſe ſeen, upon this Gorna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, a Black Serpent, that encircled the two Heads: in manner of a Garland; and that with ſo much perfection, that <hi>Albertus</hi> could not believe, that it was the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip of Nature: <hi>Probavi autem</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>quod non eſt vitrum, ſed lapis: propter quod praeſumpſi, Picturam illam eſſe à naturâ,</hi>

In a word, it was in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing defective, ſave that the Forehead was ſomewhat greater then the Life: and the reaſon of it was, ſaith he, becauſe that the

Now if Nature doth produce, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong theſe litle Flints, ſome that bear One Letter, and many alſo that have Two, or Three; why may ſhe not as well produce One greater ſtone, where the word <hi>Maria</hi> may be found at length? And if any man have a minde to impute this, to ſome extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Working of God, I ſhall not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him: as it is in like manner ſaid of the fore-mentioned Old man at <hi>Bethlehem;</hi> which is conceaved to be the Portraiture of <hi>St. Jerome,</hi> which was thus wonderfully repreſented upon the Marble, by reaſon of the great Devotion he bare to the <hi>Cratch:</hi> And in this ſenſe, I ſhall be able much more eaſily to make good the Power of Figures, which I have undertaken to maintaine: although I ſhall notwithſtanding endeavour hereafter to produce ſuch naturall Reaſons, as ſhall confirme the truth of my Aſſertion. The ſame <hi>Nider</hi> reports alſo, that the Marqueſſe <hi>de Bade</hi> had a Precious Stone, that, on which ſide ſo ever you looked on it, it alwayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:114719:75"/>a Crucifixe, naturally figured on it. As for that other ſtrange Effect which was obſerved in it, it was rather Externall, then particularly Appropriate, either to the Stone, or to the Figure. For they ſay, that if a woman, that had her Monethly Courſes upon her, chanced to look on it, it inſtantly covered it ſelfe with a little darke Cloud; which afterwards vaniſhed by little and little. Peradventure it was poliſhed, and made as ſmooth, as Looking-glaſſes are, which are often obſerved to be ſullied, and looſe their Luſtre, when women in that Condition have looked upon them. <hi>Goropius Becanus</hi> alſo affirmes, that he himſelfe ſaw in <hi>England,</hi>

                     <pb n="109" facs="tcp:114719:75"/>which repreſented two Roſes; and of another, that was full of ſtarres. You may have recourſe to the Tract which hee hath written of this ſubject,<note place="margin">Lib. de rerum foſſil. lap. et gem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar. fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gur.</note> divided into Thirteen Chapters; where he tels you, of many <hi>Gamahes,</hi> which repreſent, ſome, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets; others, Plants, Fruits, Fiſhes, Living Creatures of the Land; and ſome Artificiall things too. I wonder notwithſtanding, that he ſhould forget to ſpeake of Emboſſed <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mahes,</hi> which the earth produceth: ſuch as was that of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> holding her Sonne in her armes; which was, Natutally repreſented in a piece of a Rocke, and with very great Reliefe; and was found, in one of the Iſles of the <hi>Archipelago;</hi> as <hi>Thevet</hi> teſtifies, in his <hi>Coſmography.</hi> And in the Caves that are found in a certaine Deſart,<note place="margin">Loc. ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat.</note> in <hi>Provence</hi> in France, called <hi>l' Hermitage Sainct Maurin,</hi> diſtant two leagues from <hi>Reiz,</hi> and from <hi>Mouſtiers:</hi> a Deſart, that is indeed a very horrid one, by reaſon that it is encompaſſed with Rocks, but which is much more to be admired, then that of the <hi>Grand Chartreuſe:</hi> whether you conſider the Aire of it, which is, for the moſt part, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reene, and pleaſant; or its Chriſtall Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, whoſe Originall is wonderfull: or the beauty of its Caves, which ſeem to be a Palace, fit for Nature to inhabit: or the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:114719:76"/>Flowings of its <hi>Verdon;</hi> which being pent up by too ſmall a Channell, makes a noyſe, which cauſeth a Horror ſuitable to thoſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Solitudes: in theſe Caves, I ſay, are found good ſtore of theſe <hi>Gamahes,</hi> Emboſſed; which repreſent almoſt all the ſeverall ſorts of Figures, that can fall within a mans Imagination. You ſhall ſee ſome of them, as hanging on high; others appeare, as placed ſide-wayes; as you ſee Images placed in wals: as if Nature had not forgotten any thing, that might ſerve to render a place com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable. About ſeven leagues from <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xerre,</hi> in thoſe Caves which they call, <hi>Antou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noirs,</hi> there are found almoſt the very ſame <hi>Gamahes,</hi> or Figures: and both the one, and the other, have all of them a little hole in them, running along through them from the top to the bottome: and my judgement of theſe Figures is, that they are nothing elſe but water petrified, or congealed to ſtone: for they hang downe, (at leaſt the greateſt part of them) as if they were faſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a Roofe above.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Goropius Becanus,</hi> ſpeaking of this kind of <hi>Gamahe,</hi> aſſures us, that he hath ſeen Bones, that have beene produced Naturally within the bowels of the Earth; which were of a very Prodigious magnitude, though they were generated of other Matter. And of this
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:114719:76"/>Kind peradventure are thoſe Bones, whoſe vaſt bigneſſe hath cauſed people vainely to conclude, that there have beene heretofore Gyants in the World: So true it is, that for want of the true knowledge of the Secrets of Nature, men uſually fall into moſt groſſe Errors. Now theſe Emboſſed Figures that are found in ſtones, are of two ſorts: the firſt, are whole Emboſſed round; as was the Piece of Rocke in forme of the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> and theſe Bones, that the Earth Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally produceth: the Other are only in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, or only halfe-emboſſed: ſuch as were thoſe Rocks, which <hi>Ortelius</hi> makes mention of, ſcituate in the entrance of the moſt We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern parts of <hi>Tartary;</hi> on which are to be ſeen the Figures of Camels, Horſes, Sheep, and many other things; the Marvellouſneſſe whereof this Geographer being not able to comprehend, he ſaies: <hi>Haec ſaxa, hominum,</hi>

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:114719:77"/>to flye to Maracles:) I ſay, that theſe <hi>Tartarian</hi> Rockes (if there be any Truth in the Relation,) are only <hi>Gamahes,</hi> generated by Nature: Otherwiſe, wee ſhall be forced to forge new Miracles, for all the Places, where ever any of the like Effects are produced; which would be moſt ridiculous, ſeeing that we ſhall by and by make it appear, out of the Writings of one of the moſt Pious, &amp; Learned Men, the Ages paſt have brought forth, that theſe Effects are the Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Nature only, who produceth them no otherwiſe, then ſhee doth Flowers. Of this ſort of <hi>Gamahes</hi> were thoſe three Serpents, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured within the hollow of an Oiſter-ſhell, which were found, by the King of <hi>Caſtile's</hi> Cookes, in the belly of a Fiſh. Theſe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents were figured with their Head Relieved, or ſwelling up; and that ſo naturally, as that they ſeemed to be alive. The upper part of the Shell alſo afforded pretty Variety of the like Figures: and, which was moſt of all to be admired, there was not one of them, but had a Hole running along through it, from the very Mouth to the Taile, though it were indeed but a very ſmall one. Therfore ſaith <hi>Albertus Magnus,</hi>

                  <p n="4">4. Thoſe Figures that are Naturally In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:114719:77"/>upon Stones, are either graved Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially only; or Tranſparently, ſo as the Graving paſſes through the body. Of this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter kind you ſhall oftentimes meet with ſome, among the heapes of hollow ſtones, that are found in the fields; wherein you may obſerve the form of a Head, by the little Holes, which repreſent the Eyes, the Noſtrils, and the Mouth: and ſometimes alſo you ſhall have of them, that have the forme of a Death's head, either of a Man, or a Horſe. As for thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which are only ſuperficially graved, you may have ſtore of them, among the little ſtones on the Bankes of Rivers, and upon the Sea-ſhore: where you ſhall light upon ſome, ſo exactly repreſenting the figure of ſhells, that you would think they were the Naturall ſhels of Fiſhes: and this ſort ought rather to be reckoned in the number of <hi>Emboſſed-Gama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hes,</hi> then thoſe that are ſimply <hi>Graved.</hi> My Brother hath ſometime been very diligent in ſearching on the Sea ſhore, and gathering to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether what Shels, or other Stones of any ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, he could meet with: and he hath preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted one to Mr. <hi>Frey,</hi> which perfectly reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth a Goat's Horne: and I am of opinion, that it is one of thoſe, which the Ancients called, <hi>Cornu Ammonis;</hi> as you may ſee in <hi>Georg. Agricola,</hi> in his <hi>Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>de Natura Foſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilium.</hi> I thought at firſt, when I ſaw ſome
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:114719:78"/>of theſe Stones figured like ſhells, that they had been at firſt Reall ſhels of Fiſhes, which had afterward been Petrified, and turned into Stone, by the Vertue of ſome kind of water; they were ſo perfectly, and exactly formed. But I have ſince conſidered, that, ſeeing that there are found of them upon the tops of the higheſt Hills, they muſt neceſſarily be <hi>Gama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hes,</hi> and the Workmanſhip of Nature; which without doubt hath not produced them, but to ſome end; as we ſhall ſee hereafter. From hence you may judge,<note place="margin">In Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſe.</note> whether, or no, <hi>Gore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius</hi> hath not good reaſon to reprove thoſe, that confidently affirme, that <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and a part of <hi>Aethiopia</hi> hath heretofore been cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all over with the Sea, becauſe that there are ſome of theſe ſhels frequently found in thoſe Parts. For we may as well conclude, by the ſame Argument, that the <hi>Apennine,</hi> the <hi>Alpes,</hi> and the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Hils, have been ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time alſo overwhelmed with the Sea; which is moſt Abſurd: unleſſe they meane, at the Generall Deluge: but this is not their Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Let us now come to the Figures of Plants.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The moſt Learned among the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſts divide them thus. A Plant, ſay they, is either <hi>Arbor,</hi> or <hi>Cremium,</hi> or <hi>Frutex,</hi> or <hi>Herba.</hi> A Tree is a Plant, that hath a great Trunke, or body: the <hi>Cremium</hi> hath but a
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:114719:78"/>little one: the <hi>Frutex</hi> hath many: and the <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be,</hi> is that, which at its firſt Appearing out of the ground, puts forth only two little leaves. I find then, that in all the ſeverall Kinds, there is an Infinite Number of Admirable Figures, which are called by the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, <hi>Signaturae rerum:</hi> now, One Part on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of a Figured Plant, and not the whole Plant, is called <hi>Signatura:</hi> or you may ſay, the <hi>Signature,</hi> is ſome certain thing in that Part. I ſpeake not here of <hi>Internall Signatures;</hi> the Doctrine of theſe belong to Chymiſts: My purpoſe only is, in this place, to diſcourſe of thoſe that we meet withall in Plants, which the Ages paſt have taken very little notice of. I ſhall begin then to ſhew, in order to the parts of Plants, what <hi>Signatures,</hi> or Marvellous Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, Nature hath produced in them.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, the Root of diverſe ſorts of Plants, repreſenteth diverſe parts of Our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: as, that of the <hi>Hermodactil,</hi> reſembles a man's Hand.</p>
                  <p>The Body, or Stocke'iis yet more Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable: for whether it be in great Trees, or in ſmall Plants, you ſhall find Figures, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the Parts of Living Creatures. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong theſe later, the <hi>Serpentaria major</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly reſembles the skinne of a Serpent; as doth alſo the <hi>Dracunculus,</hi> and the <hi>Ophioſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodon:</hi> among the Former, wee muſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:114719:79"/>either the Wood, or the Barke of them.</p>
                  <p>In the Barke you ſhall many times ſee, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in that of Old Trees, many Figures, repreſenting diverſe Kinds of things, by the Various Cranies and Clifts that are in it. In young Trees, where the Barke is cloſer, it is figured with many little Streakes, and Lines, in the nature of Painting: and I have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time obſerved, upon the Barke of a young Cherry Tree, the figure of Little Trees laden with fruit, ſo naturally expreſt, as if it had been done with a Pencill.</p>
                  <p>The Wood is yet more Admirable, then the reſt; ſeeing that in many Trees, there is the very ſame Variety found, that is in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats:</hi> and it is not many daies ſince I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that there was a Tree lately found in <hi>Holland,</hi> which being cut in pieces by a wood-cleaver, they ſaw, in one part of it, the Figure of a Chalice; in another, that of a Prieſts Albe; in another, that of a Stole; and, in a word, there were repreſented very near all the Ornaments belonging to a Prieſt. If the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation be true, we muſt needs confeſſe, that theſe Figures could not be there Caſually, or by chance.<note place="margin">In La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer;</hi> and in Flem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh, <hi>Maſaros.</hi>
                     </note> But, to come to a kind of wood that is more Common; in boards of Maple, which is a wood ſufficiently known to every body, you ſhall often find the figure of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:114719:79"/>of a Bird, of a Fly, &amp;c. perfectly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, by the ſtreakes of this variegated Wood. There are alſo ſome other ſorts of Wood, that repreſent ſome of theſe Figures, but not Painted, but Imboſſed. So, at what time I was a Student at <hi>Apt,</hi> a City in <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence:</hi> very famous for the Relicks of Saint <hi>Anne,</hi> mother to the Bleſſed Virgin, which are ſaid to be kept in this place; I ſaw the Trunke of a Vine, which repreſented a Man's Face, as far as the haire of the Head, ſo live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as that you might percieve the Fore-head, the Eyes, Noſe, Eares, Mouth, Chin, all exactly formed, and in very good propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It was brought by a Vineyard-keeper, to the ſhop of M. <hi>Roulet,</hi> a Surgeon.</p>
                  <p>The Branches of Plants are leſſe Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, in matter of Figures, then all the reſt; (though it were in Wood:) nevertheleſſe you may oftentimes obſerve in them, ſome kind of Reſemblances of the Fingers of a Man's hand; and of the Buſhineſſe of his Haire. And this is the reaſon, in my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, why the Poets, when they diſcourſe, in their <hi>Metamorphoſes,</hi> of the Transforming of Men into Trees, they ſay that their Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and the Haire of their Head, were chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into Branches.

The Externall are, all ſuch as are Painted, and Coloured on the Outſide of the Fruit, but <gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

<pb n="122" facs="tcp:114719:82"/>not at all Within; in like manner as the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, called in <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>Fambure,</hi> is; which is all ſpeckled with red ſpots, like drops of bloud, but only on the Outſide, or Rind. Thoſe that are both Internally, and Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally Figured, are ſuch as the Maple Wood; and many ſorts of Stones. The Internall Figures are likewiſe diſcovered, either by Any Manner of Cutting Indifferently; or elſe, by one certain Particular Way only. That which appeares after Any Manner of Cutting indifferently, is, as in that kind of Apple,<note place="margin">In Forn.</note> which, as <hi>Nider</hi> reports, hath beene ſeen at <hi>Granada,</hi> which being cut any manner of way, did ſtill nevertheleſſe repreſent the Figure of a Crucifixe. That which requires One only Particular way of Cutting, is, as in the Root of Fearne; which being cut One way only, repreſents an Eagle perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. I have often obſerved, that an Orenge likewiſe ſo cut, not a-croſſe, but long-waies, repreſents, with its kernels and little skins, an Orenge Tree laden with Orenges. It is alſo obſerved, that the Kernels of an Apple repreſent the Tree.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Figures doe yet conſiſt, either in the Colour; or in the Diviſion of the Parts: in the Colour; as in the flowre of the Hearb Eye-bright, which repreſenteth thoſe of an Eye: in the Diviſion of the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:114719:82"/>Parts; as namely, in thoſe we have already ſpoken of.</p>
                  <p>Thus have we ſeen the Diviſion of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures: it remaines now, that we prove, that they have ſome Power to operate; and, that it is not in Vaine, that they are perfectly repreſented both in Plants, and Stones. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed we therefore, in the ſame Order we have obſerved in our Diviſion, beginning with the Firſt.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. I ſay then, that the Naturall Figures, which are found in Stones, have Naturally a Power to Operate, if they be Applied: and this I ſhall prove, by two Reaſons. The Firſt is, becauſe they are called <hi>Effectrices:</hi> and the Second is, becauſe we ſee it by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience: For we daily ſee, that ſome of theſe Figured Stones do Operate upon the Same Things that they repreſent; as for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, that Stone which we call <hi>Heliotropi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> which is all ſpeckled as it were with Drops of Bloud, if applied to the part that bleeds, it ſtops the Bloud. Others there are, that worke upon the Wound that is made by the Image they beare. So <hi>Pliny</hi> affirmes, that there is a kind of Marble cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Ophites,</hi> by reaſon of its reſembling the Figure of Serpents, whoſe name it beares: which, if applied to the wound cauſed by the biting of thoſe Venemous Creatures,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:114719:83"/>it healeth it. See his own words: <hi>Genus Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moris ab Ophite dictum,</hi>

                     <hi>quòd imaginem ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Serpentum repraſentet; molle, candidum; nigranſque, durum; dicuntur ambo Serpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum ictus ſedare.</hi> And here we may make This Diviſion of the Figures that are found in Stones; and ſay, that they are of two ſorts. The one are found in ſome certaine ſtones, and are alwaies the ſame: and theſe are Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally endued with very admirable Vertues. The other, are ſuch as are not tyed to any certaine ſort of Stones; but are indifferently found in all; and are not indeed of ſo great Vertue,<note place="margin">De Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til. l. <hi>7.</hi>
                     </note> as the Former. And this is the diviſion that <hi>Cardan</hi> makes of them: <hi>Verum,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>mire quiſpiam dubitet, vnde figure hae in Gemmis, &amp; lapidibus proveniant? neque enim credendum eſt omnem figuran caſu contingere, cùm lapides multi ex eodem genere eaſdem retineant figuras. Itaque meo judicio, dicendum eſt, duo eſſe Figuram &amp; Imaginum genera: alterum, quod ſemper in eiſdem lapidibus apparet, et hoc a Naturâ provenit; quae non ſecùs ac in plantis, folio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum et fructum numerum ſervat &amp; rationem. Hoc figurarum genus vim habet, &amp; aliquid ſignificat, &amp;c.</hi> And ſo going on, he makes mention of a Stone, which <hi>Albertus Magnus</hi> had; that, being naturally marked with the Figure of a Serpent, had this admirable
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:114719:83"/>Vertue, that if it were put in a place that was haunted with Serpents, it drew them all unto it. He ſpeaks alſo of diverſe others, that would cure the biting of Serpents, and expell their Venom. You may ſee diverſe of theſe admirable <hi>Gamahes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lib. <hi>1.</hi> loc. cit.</note> in <hi>Georgius Agricola;</hi> who reckons up, what ſtones there are, that repreſent all the parts of mans body; as well as thoſe rare Fruits, and Plants do, which we ſhall hereafter ſpeak of.</p>
                  <p>And here it is commonly objected, that it is not at all the Figure, that produceth any ſuch effect; but ſome occult Quality, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the ſtone is endued. For otherwiſe, if the Figure were Operative, one drop of Blood would ſtop Others; and a living Scorpion ſhould cure the ſtinging of another Scorpion: foraſmuch as there is much more conformity, and nearneſſe of Reſemblance, betwixt two Reall drops of Blood, or two living Scorpions, then betwixt one Pictu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and one living One, &amp;c. And this is the ſtrongeſt Objection, that our moderne Philoſophers do bring, and by which they do conceave themſelves to have overthrown, (though they haue litle reaſon ſo to do,) the Power, which the Ancients attributed to Figures.</p>
                  <p>Firſt therefore, to anſwere theſe Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it is true indeed, that the bare Figure
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:114719:84"/>repreſented on ſtones, hath not of It Selfe any power at all to operate, though applied; except there be ſome Internall, or Externall Agent, that may co-operate, and aſſiſt the Figure; or unleſſe the matter be Proper, and Apt to operate: as, for example, a Pointed Figure wil never be able to Penetrate, though it be applyed; if it be either of ſoft Waxe, or of Butter: becauſe that the Matter is not at all proper to Penetration: but the ſame Figure in Wood, Iron, Braſſe, or any other hard Matter, will very eaſily pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate. In like manner, if a Stone have not, either from the ſtarres, or from its own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſome Quality proper to ſuch, or ſuch an effect; as for ſtopping of Blood, ſome Reſtringent Quality; and ſo of the reſt: in vaine ſhould we expect to finde any perfect power in the Figure. To ſay then, that it is (for example) this onely Reſtringent Quality, that ſtops the Blood; and that the Figure of the drops of Blood, wherewith the Stone is ſpotted, and painted, is of no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment at all in the buſineſſe; is to fall back into the former Error: For, to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe then hath Nature beſtowed this Figure on the Stone? there muſt neceſſarily be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſome kind of reaſon for it. If it be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that Nature had no purpoſed End, in giving this Figure: this were to deny that
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:114719:84"/>Principle, which is generally receaved by all: <hi>Id non fruſtrà fit, quod Natura ſemper facit, vel plurimùm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There were indeed very good Reaſon to doubt of this Power, if the Marble called <hi>Ophites,</hi> (which repreſents the Figures of Serpents, by whoſe name it is called,) would cure the biting of a Dog, or of a Horſe only: But ſeeing it cures the ſtinging of Serpents onely, and of no other Beaſt; why ſhould we not attribute ſomething to the very Figure? But to prove more forcibly, that theſe Figures have ſome Power to Operate; againſt the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſſe of thoſe that diſpute againſt it: if thoſe which repreſent Scorpions, Serpents, Toads, do find the nature of the place Proper, and aptly diſpoſed for the ſupplying of the Stone, or other Matter on which they are found, with a Quality, and Nutriment, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Nature of the Thing, whoſe I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage they beare; theſe Figures will then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be turned into Reall Serpents, Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions, and living Toads, and into no other kind of Creature. So that our Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers need not now vexe themſelves any more to find out, how, or by what meanes a Toad ſhould come to be generated in the midſt of a great ſtone; as was that, deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by <hi>Georgius Agricola,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">De Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal. ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ier.</note> which was found within a Mil-ſtone, when it was crackt, or
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:114719:85"/>broken in pieces, either by the force of the Venom, or elſe by the Violence of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and alſo how that Other was generated, which <hi>Goropius Becanus</hi> ſaw at <hi>Anvers,</hi> which was found in the Sawing in two of a very thicke Marble Stone, that had neither Hole, nor Rift in it. For, the Figure of a Toad having beene firſt repreſented within theſe Stones, it ſo came to paſſe, that by ſome Property of the Place, it was afterward chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into a Naturall, Living Toad. And the very ſelfe ſame may happen in any other Figures, except that of Man; whoſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricke is from the hand of God alone. We may conclude therefore that theſe Figures are not repreſented in vain, both on Stones, and on other things: ſeeing that if they be Rightly Applyed, they aſſuredly have ſome Secret Power, according to the Principle before laid down. And here I had almoſt forgotten to informe the Reader, that, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſearching after any forraine Examples, we may dayly ſee, at the Plaiſteries at <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentueil,</hi> the like Toads, and other ſuch Creatures, engendred with Stones, and the very hart of the hardeſt Rockes. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceave therefore, that after the very ſame wonderfull manner of Generation, thoſe fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhels alſo, which are found on the tops of Mountaines, are produced: not in the Sea,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:114719:85"/>(as ſome Ridiculouſly have imagined;) but upon the very place where they are found: which gave occaſion to that Curious Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer into the Secrets of Nature, to draw from hence this Concluſion:<note place="margin">Gorop. in Niloſc.</note> 
                     <hi>Ubicunquè igitur humor, ſive liquor invenitur, ad Teſtaceorum vitam idoneus, viva Teſtacea generantur.</hi> He ſpeaks this in diſcourſing of diverſe ſeverall Figures, or <hi>Gamahes,</hi> that he had ſeen, in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe places: and then he goes on, and ſayes further; <hi>Opifex enim progeditur eò, quoad ejus materia patitur, ultrà progreſſurus, ſi loci &amp; materiae inopiâ non excluderetur.</hi> If a Figure then have ſo much Power, as to change it ſelfe into that Living Creature that it repreſents, (provided that it meet with no Impediment;) how can it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, but that they alſo have the Power to Worke, by ſome ſecret Sympathy, (if ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled,) upon the Wound given by the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which they reſemble?</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Now, why the ſame Figure ſhould not rather hurt, then heale a wound ſo given; ſeeing that the Living Creature it ſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Venomous, its Figure alſo, ſhould by Sympathy be Venomous, rather then Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: the Reaſon, I confeſſe, is very Darke, and hard to be given: nevertheleſſe I ſhall here adventure, the Firſt, on this diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; no man, that I know of, having as yet undertaken it.</p>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:114719:86"/>
                  <p>We have therefore ſaid before, that, when the Figure of a Scorpion, (for example,) being repreſented on a Stone, findes in the place where it is, any Nutriment, or Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, agreeable to the Nature of a Living Scorpion; it by little and little acquires Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and having at length drawn forth all that which was proper for a Scorpion, it becomes a Living Scorpion. Wee do alſo ſuppoſe, that when this Venomous Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or a Serpent, Dog, or any other Beaſt chanceth to bite any; they leave an Impreſſion of ſome Particular Quality be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind: as we ſee in thoſe that are bitten by a <hi>Tarantuba,</hi> who preſently fall into a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall Agitation; (not that they continually Daunce, as the generall Talke is:) this Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomous Creature having this Quality, that it is alwayes in continuall motion; and though it be cut into many ſmall pieces, yet it will not leave ſtirring a long time after. And ſo likewiſe <hi>Pomponacius,</hi> and <hi>Campanella</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that if a Mad Dog bite a Woman with child,<note place="margin">De In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caut. De ſenſ. rer.</note> if there be not ſpeedy Remedy uſed, the Fruit of her Wombe will be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the ſhape of a Dog, and it will after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards come into the World, with all the Liniaments of a Dog. So true it is, that if we ſhould but inquire into the Effects of Nature, and ſhould be able to yeeld the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:114719:86"/>of them; we would ſcorne all that we think we now know. Now I ſay, that the Figure of a Scorpion, that is Naturally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented on a Stone, is ſtill endeavouring is own Perfection; and where ever it meets with any ſuch Qualities, as are Proper to it ſelfe, it attracts, and draws them to it. If therefore the Figure of a Scorpion, be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to a Wound made by a Scorpion: it there findes the Impreſſion of ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Quality, made by a Scorpion: which, finding to be Proper and Agreeable to its own Nature, it attracts and retaines with it ſelfe: ſo that the Wound, being thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered of theſe Qualities that envenomed it, preſently heales up, and growes well again. In a word, the Stronger here prevailes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Weaker: ſo that in the Figure of a Scorpion, which nature hath repreſented on a Stone, there being greater Store found of the Qualities proper to this Creature, then there is in the Wound which the Scorpion made; thoſe which are here, are drawn forth by thoſe other, which are in the Stone, as being the ſtronger, and of greater Vertue. Upon this Principle alſo it is, that a Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion bruiſed to pieces, and applied to the Wound, cures it; as doth alſo its Oyle. The biting of the Serpent is alſo healed, by the applying of its head, beat in pieces; or
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:114719:87"/>elſe, by the Serpent it ſelfe, reduced into Powder; as <hi>Crollius,</hi> and <hi>M. du Cheſne, S. de la Violette,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">De ſign. Plant. En la Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation de The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riaques.</note> affirme: as likewiſe that of a Crocodile, is cured by its Fat: that of a Rat, by its Fleſh made into Powder; that of a Dog, by its Haire, or Skinne: the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom of a Toad is cured by a certaine Stone, that is found in its Head: And if we ſhould ſearch after the Properties of other Living Creatures,<note place="margin">Toads<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone.</note> we ſhould doubtleſſe finde the ſame thing in all of them. Upon this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple alſo it is, that if an Egge that is frozen, be put into Cold Water, it will be thawed in a very ſhort ſpace: and Hands, that are benummed with cold, will preſently become unbenummed, if they be put into cold Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or into Snow-broth. For, the Grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Cold, which is in the Water, finding the Leſſe, which is in the Hands; it draws in forth, and ſwallows it up; juſt as a ſmall Candle is loſt, if it be placed neer a great Fire, or a Red-hot Furnace. But if the Cold, that is in the Hands, were greater then that in the Water; and the Venom, that is in the Wound made by a Scorpions Sting, were more Powerfull, then that of the Scorpions Figure applied to it; wee ſhould then ſee a clean Contrary Effect.</p>
                  <p>To go on then in our Anſwer to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection propoſed, I ſay thus: We deny not,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:114719:87"/>but that there is a greater Correſpondency betwixt two Reall, Naturall drops of Blood; and betwixt Two Living Scorpions; then betwixt a Living one, and a Painted. Yea, we rather, on the contrary, acknowledge; that the great Analogy, and Reſemblance that there is betwixt them, is the cauſe that Blood, either broken into little pieces by ſtirring, or freſhly drawn, and applied to a Wound, ſtops the bleeding of it; as Experience teſtifies, if we may believe <hi>Crollius:</hi> and the Oyle of Haires diſtilled, keepes the Haire from falling off: ſo Earth-wormes, made into a Powder, deſtroy thoſe that are bred in Our Bodies: and the Gravell of the Urine wee make, is an excellent Medicine againſt the Stone: and many other Properties there are obſerved to proceed from this Analogy, or neareneſſe of Reſemblance. But to returne to our Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures again.</p>

The Power of thoſe, that are found in Plants, and their parts, ſeemes to have ſome Affinity with that of the Figures in Stones; ſeeing that they alſo Operate on the ſame things that they repreſent: as, for Example, the Citrull Cowcumber, which in ſome ſort reſembles the figure of a Man's Head, is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſoveraigne remedy, as <hi>Porta</hi> affirmes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Diſeaſes of the Head.<note place="margin">B.

And here it may be Objected, that the greateſt part of theſe plants, though they be reduced into Aſhes, yet do they not faile to worke the ſame Effects, and to have the ſame Quality, that they had before: and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Power is to be attributed to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Plant, and not at all to the Figure; which it now no longer retaines, when it is

                  <p>I anſwer, that though they be chopt in pieces, brayed in a Mortar, and even burnt to Aſhes; yet do they nevertheleſſe retaine, (by a certaine Secret, and wonderfull Power of Nature,) both in the Juyce, and in the Aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, the ſelfe ſame Forme, and Figure, that they had before: and though it be not there Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yet it may by Art be drawne forth, and made Viſible to the Eye, by an Artiſt.

                  <p n="12">12. After the Figures that are found in Stones, and Plants, our Diviſion leads us to thoſe that are found in Living Creatures, both Rationall, and Irrationall; euen downe to Fiſhes.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe then that are found in Fiſhes, are, Characters, Ciphers, or all kinds of Armes: ſuch as were figured not many years ſince, upon a Fiſh, whoſe Picture was publickly ſold up and down, though it was infinitely corrupted from the true ſhape of the Fiſh it was made for. There are ſome other Marks, or Figures, that are leſſe corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which have been found upon Fiſhes; ſuch as are thoſe, which are ſet down in a Book, intitled <hi>Prophetia Halieutica,</hi> the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor whereof was one <hi>Raphael Eglin,</hi> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of <hi>Zurich.</hi> Of the Three Fiſhes then,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:114719:92"/>that he there treats of, which were marked with theſe kinds of Figures, two of them were taken on the Coaſt of <hi>Norway, An.</hi> 1587. <hi>November</hi> 21. and the other, on the Coaſt of <hi>Pomerania, An.</hi> 1596. <hi>Mai.</hi> 21. And the Figures, which he there ſets down, are truly worth our Conſideration: but, to goe about to make them ſuit with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies of <hi>Daniel,</hi> and of St. <hi>John,</hi> as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanias Jerancurius</hi> hath heretofore endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to doe, is to make ones ſelf appear Extravagant, and to talk more idly, then men in Fevers uſe to do.</p>
                  <p>The Figures, that are found upon Beaſts of the Land, are better known, then thoſe upon Fiſhes: for it hath been often obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that the Hornes of Deer have been Marked with certain Characters; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times too, even with the ſhapes of Living Creatures, which have been perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented by them. So we have ſometimes ſeen Cats, and Horſes, which have had upon their skins ſuch ſpots of White, Red, or Black, that by the intermixing of the ſtreaks of the ſeverall-coloured haire, there hath been repreſented the Figure of another Cat, or Horſe. And if we did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe, whatſoever we account to be either Feidiculous, or of Little Conſideration; we ſhould not be put to the trouble of making
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:114719:92"/>ſo many ſtrange Inquiries, which are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more Vain, then Profitable.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, the Figures which are found upon Rationall Creatures, are ſuch as the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of the Mother, during the time of her Going with Child, hath imprinted there. And here I could enter into a Large Diſcourſe, concerning the Secrets of theſe Figures; which are not Commonly known: but, for brevities ſake, I ſhall only give the Reader here one or two Remarkable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, which prove very powerfully the Vertue, which we attribute to all Figures. A Siſter of mine had the Figure of a Fiſh upon her Left Leg, cauſed by the deſire my mother had to eat Fiſh, when ſhe was Great: and it is repreſented with ſo much Perfection, and Raritie, that you would take it to be drawn by ſome Excellent Maſter. Now That, wherein the Wonder lies, is, that when ever the Girle eat any Fiſh, That upon her Leg put her to a ſenſible pain. And I had a Friend, that had a Mulbery growing upon his Forehead; cauſed like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe by his Mothers Longing after them: and he never eat Mulberies, but that his own on his Forehead put him to pain by it's Extraordinary Beating.</p>
                  <p>This other Story, which I ſhall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, to the ſame purpoſe, is very well known
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:114719:93"/>to all in <hi>Paris,</hi> that are Curious Inquirers after theſe things. The Hoſteſſe of the Inne in the Suburbs of St <hi>Michael,</hi> at <hi>Bois de Vincenne,</hi> who died about two years ſince, had likewiſe a Mulbery growing upon her Lower Lip; which was ſmooth, and plain, all the year long, till the time that Mulbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries begin to ripen; at which time, Hers al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo began to be red, and to ſwell more and more, obſerving exactly the Seaſon, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of other Mulberies, and comming at length up to the Juſt Bigneſſe, and Redneſs of other ripe Mulberies. But, that I may not trouble my ſelf any further, in recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning up any more of theſe kinds of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, I ſhall deſire the Reader, to draw from hence a Conſequence of the Power of them by theſe two, or three Examples, which I have here ſet down.</p>

It will be objected perhaps, that theſe <hi>Arabians</hi> are Trifling, Vaine Writers;
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:114719:97"/>and therefore that there is little credit to be given to them.

Now all theſe <hi>Taliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> were not made ſo much for the avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Shipwrack only, as for the turning away of ſOme other Diſaſtrous Accidents, or the procuring of ſome good Fortune, or other. And from this practiſe of the Ancients have the Chriſtians taken Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, though in a Chriſtian way, of having Images in their Veſſels, and Picturing in them the Saints whoſe names they bear.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. But ſince that I am unawares fallen upon this Choiſe Piece of Antiquity, I ſhall here further adde, that theſe <hi>Taliſmans</hi> were not ſet up in Cities only, and Ships, but alſo in the plaine, open Fields too: and it may be, that that Stone ſo much famed among the Turks, which they call <hi>Bractan,</hi> and is ſet up at <hi>Mecha,</hi> being four foot long, and two foot broad, as <hi>Suidas</hi> reports, was only a <hi>Taliſman.</hi> For otherwiſe we muſt even content our ſelves with Turkiſh Fables, and believe, that it would never have been ſo highly prized by them, but for that it ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved inſtead of a Bed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he had knoweldge of his Maid <hi>Hagar:</hi> For, beſides that this is ridiculous, the Turkes will never acknowledge themſelves to the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtards, and deſcended from a Servant-maid; but from <hi>Sarah:</hi> and this is the reaſon, that
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:114719:100"/>they are ſo much delighted in being called <hi>Saraſins.</hi> Others ſay, that the reaſon why the Turks have this Stone in ſo much Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, is, becauſe that <hi>Abraham</hi> tyed his Camell to it, when he went up to the top of the Mountaine to ſacrifice his ſonne; as <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thymius Zigabenus</hi> affirmes:<note place="margin">In Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopl.</note> or, as ſome others of the more Trifling ſort of the Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian Writers will have it, becauſe it was erected in memory of a certaine Holy Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who was taken up into Heaven, and afterward honoured upon Earth as a God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe, for having very charitably en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained the Angels <hi>Arot,</hi> and <hi>Marot.</hi> That which moved theſe later to forge theſe Fables, was the Figure of <hi>Venus,</hi> which is ingraved upon this Stone, with a <hi>Creſcent:</hi> and this is that which makes me beleeve, that it was a <hi>Taliſman</hi> of this Planet, which, as <hi>Mr. Selden</hi> ſayes,<note place="margin">Syntag. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>4.</hi>
                     </note> was anciently taken, throughout all <hi>Aſia,</hi> for the Moon. And for this Cauſe it is, that this People hath <hi>Friday</hi> in the ſame Veneration, that <hi>Sunday</hi> is with us: and that, in memory of this Starre, which all the <hi>Aſians</hi> worſhipped, the ridges of their Houſes, and tops of their Temples were adorned with litle <hi>Creſcents,</hi> as ours are with <hi>Croſſes.</hi> Now it cannot be thought, that this Stone was onely a bare, ſimple Image, erected in honour of <hi>Venus:</hi>
                     <pb n="159" facs="tcp:114719:100"/>for, beſides that it was placed in the Open Fields, and not within any Temple; it had that Vertue, which no other Image of this Goddeſſe ever had. For it drave away, ſaith <hi>Zachder,</hi> all Venomous Beaſts, and rendered all the neighbouring Fields both Happy, and Fruitfull: which is ſo farre from being obſerved in them at this day, that, on the contrary, they are all utterly barren. And this agrees excellently well with the Nature of theſe <hi>Taliſmans,</hi> whoſe Operation laſteth but for ſome certaine ſpace of time; as <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus Magnus</hi> aſſures us. <hi>Non lateat nos,</hi>

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:114719:101"/>elſe but a <hi>Taliſman:</hi> of thoſe Images of the <hi>Amorhites,</hi> which, as <hi>Philo Judaeus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, were called <hi>Nymphae ſacrae,</hi> which ſhewed to their ſlaves hourely, what ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they were to do:<note place="margin">Biblic. ant.</note> and, which being at laſt quite decayed, an Angel of the Lord, (ſeeing they could neither be broken to pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, nor burnt in the Fire) tooke, and caſt into a Bottomeleſſe Pit. Fine fooleries theſe; And here, Reader, thou art to take notice, that the Greeks were the firſt, that turned theſe Truths into Fables; for having lighted on ſome of theſe Images, that had beene made long before, and ſeeing them to have ſuch Admirable, Strange Vertues in them; being unable to apprehend the reaſon of theſe things, they preſently betook them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to forging of Old, Ridiculous ſtories of Theſe, as they have done of All Other things, the truth whereof they underſtood not.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. And here, two Queſtions may be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked: the Firſt is, whether the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures make any mention of theſe <hi>Taliſmani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> Figures, or not? and the Second; when they were firſt Invented; and by whom?</p>
                  <p>To the Firſt of theſe I anſwere, that as in none of the Tranſlations, ſo neither in the Originall Hebrew is the name of theſe <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſmans</hi> found: although there are of thoſe
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:114719:101"/>men that attribute all things to the Power of Nature onely, as Atheiſts do, who ſtick not to affirme, that the <hi>Braſen Serpent,</hi> ſet up by <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Wilderneſſe, was but a meere <hi>Taliſman,</hi> which drove away Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, and healed the bitings of them. But this their Opinion is confuted by this; that the Matter, of which a <hi>Taliſman</hi> is made, muſt not be any whit contrary to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Griefe which it is to cure. Now all the <hi>Rabbins,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Vid. Pont. Bibl. conc. col. <hi>2.</hi> in Igno. S. Cruc. p. <hi>270.</hi>
                     </note> who have treated upon this Hiſtory, affirme; that, according to the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of all the Naturaliſts, there is nothing more contrary to thoſe that are bitten by Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, then to touch, or look upon Copper: ſo that this ſhould have added to the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites Torment, and more invenomed their Wound, rather then have cured them. And this was the reaſon perhaps, why God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Moſes</hi> to make a Serpent of Braſſe, rather then of Any Other Metall; that ſo this Incredulous People might know, that ſeeing that God cured them by a Remedy, quite contrary to their Diſeaſe; he was able as well to bring them ſafely into the place, to which they deſpaired of ever arriving. And here by the way, I cannot excuſe <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilius Ficinus,</hi> who without any ground at all hath charged the <hi>Rabbins</hi> with having a beliefe, that their Forefathers made the Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den

                  <p n="8">8. Some of thoſe <hi>Taliſmans</hi> have now quite loſt their Vertue; as namely, that

And a little above
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:114719:103"/>the City, there is a certaine Cave, which is full of the Carkaſſes, and bones of Serpents which dyed at that time.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe are his own words, tranſlated. Now whereas he calls this an <hi>Inchanted ſtone,</hi> and ſaies, that it was placed there by a <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian;</hi> you muſt note, that he there ſpeakes according to the Senſe of the Inhabitants, who knew not how to give any other account of the thing; as not underſtanding any thing at all of the Naturall reaſon of it; as we have ſayd. At <hi>Byzantium,</hi> which is now <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> there were many of theſe <hi>Taliſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall Figures</hi> to be ſeen: but the fury of War hath demoliſhed them all, to the great Prejudice of the Inhabitants.

So if the Mother in the Act, either ſtrongly Fancy Robbing, Killing, or Love, the Child will be either a Theefe, Murtherer, or an Amorous perſon: if ſhe fancy Travelling, he will be a Traveller; if Dancing, or playing on the Lute, he will be very Apt for Theſe Things; and ſo of the reſt. And we ſee by daily experience, the Effects of the ſtrong Deſires, and Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Mothers, during the time of their being with Child, upon their Children; on whom the ſtrength of their Imagination hath imprinted the Reſemblance of the ſame thing that they have deſired. And hence they ſay it is, that the Children that are got upon a Married Woman, by ſome Other Man then her own Husband, ſhall notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding have the Perfect Reſemblance of
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:114719:106"/>her Husband; becauſe that, during the Act of Generation, her Mind ſtill runs on Him, fearing leſt he ſhould come, and catch them at it. See what we have ſaid, at the end of the precedent Chapter, touching theſe Marks, cauſed by the Imagination; and how they were preſently affected, upon the Parties eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that, which they bare the Reſemblance of. You may further ſee the wonderfull effects cauſed by the power of the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, learnedly diſcourſed on, by <hi>Paracelſus, Marſilius Ficinus, Picus Mirandula, Toſtatus, Valeſius,</hi> and <hi>Medina.</hi>

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:114719:107"/>The like is obſerved alſo in other Qualities; ſo that, if the Signes be High, and in their <hi>Apogaeum,</hi> the Child (ſay the Arabians) ſhall be in like manner of a Tall, and Great Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: if they are Low; he ſhall be Low, and of a little Stature. As concerning Motion, <hi>Saturne,</hi> which hath a ſlow, and Heavy one, makes the Child likewiſe Heavy and Lazy: the <hi>Moon,</hi> which hath a Swift Motion, makes him Light, and Inconſiderate. You may have the fuller proſecution of this Diſcourſe, in thoſe two Learned Italians, <hi>Cardan,</hi>

Thus a man may conclude, that we ſhall ſee Armies, Battels, and Wars break forth, after that Launces of Fire, Swords, Trumpets, and Bucklers have been ſeen to appeare in the Aire: And chiefly, when a Comet hath appeared; of which it is uſually ſaid, <hi>Nunquam impunè viſus Cometa.</hi> And ſo likewiſe we may conclude, there will be great Effuſion of Blood, if all theſe Meteors are Redder then Ordinary: or, when the Sun and Moon, in the time of an Eclipſe, ſeeme bloody.

                  <p n="13">13. <hi>Phyſiognomy</hi> likewiſe ſhews us moſt Prodigious Effects of Reſemblance, and of Figures. For if a man endeavour to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfet any other mans Countenance, and that he fancy himſelfe to have His haire, eyes, noſe, mouth, and all other parts like Him; and, in a word, if he imagine himſelfe to be like him in his Phyſiognomy; he may by this meanes come to know, what his Naturall Inclinations, and what his Thoughts are, by the ſame, which he finds in Himſelfe, during the time of this his Making of Faces. This Opinion is grounded upon the Experience of <hi>Campanella,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ee ſenſu rerum &amp; Magia.</note> who expreſſeth himſelfe in theſe words. <hi>Cum quis hominem videt, ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim imaginari oportet, fe naſum habere, ut alter habet, et pilum, &amp; vultum, &amp; fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, &amp; locutionem: et tunc qui affectus, et cognitationes in hac cogitatione illi obrepunt, judicat homini illi eſſE proprios, quem ita ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginando contuetur. Hoc non abſque ratione &amp; Experientia. Spiritus enim format corpus, et juxta affectus innatos ipſum fingit, exprimit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que.</hi> I alwaies thought, that the opinion of <hi>Campanella</hi> was, that a man ſhould only ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine himſelfe to have the ſame Countenance with the Other; as his words ſeem to mean: but when I was at <hi>Rome,</hi> underſtanding that
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:114719:108"/>he was brought into the Inquiſition. I did, out of Curioſity to be ſatisfied in this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, take the paines to viſit him there. Being therefore in the company of ſome Abbots, we were brought to the Chamber where he was: who, as ſoon as he perceived us, came to us and intreated us to have a little patience, til he had ended a little Note, which hee was writing to <hi>Cardinall Magaloti.</hi> When we were ſate down, we obſerved him oftentimes to make certain wry <hi>Faces;</hi> which we conceived to proceed, either from folly, or elſe from ſome Pain, that the Violence of the Torments, which he had endured, put him too: the calves of his Legs being all beaten black and blew, and his buttocks ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving hardly any Fleſh on them; it having beene torne from him piece-meale, to the end they might force him to confeſſe the Crimes that he was accuſed of. But a Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>German</hi> will ſhortly publiſh the Hiſtory of his Life, and Misfortunes. To returne then to our purpoſe, one of our company, amongſt other diſcourſe, asking him, if he felt no pain: He, ſmiling, anſwered, No. And ſuppoſing that we had been ſomething troubled at the Wry FAces which he made, he told us; that, at our comming in, he fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied himſelf to be <hi>Cardinal Magaloti,</hi> as he had heard him deſcribed: and he asked Us
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:114719:109"/>withall, if he were not a very hairy man. Now, I, who had before read that Paſſage in his Book, which I have before ſet down, preſently conceaved, that theſe Wry Faces are altogether Neceſſary, for to be able to judge aright of another mans Naturall In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination. I ſhall not here ſet down what paſſed betwixt us, in this Interview; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is wholly beſides my preſent Subject. I ſhall now therefore rerurne to the Effects which are found in Phyſiognomy, and are produced by the force of Reſemblance. We ſee then by experience, and all knowing Phyſiognomiſts have obſerved it; that if a man have a Round Forehead, he is very ſubject to Folly, and Lightneſſe, being very eaſily moved any way; in like manner as a Round Figure is the moſt apt for motion: and the Naturall reaſon of this, is, becauſe that the Spirits aſcending up, and meeting with a place of a Round Figure, they are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry eaſily moved any way. It is alſo obſerved, that thoſe that have a Sharp Chin, that ſtands forward, and a little Forehead, are very Brutiſh, and Stupid: in a Word, they are qualited like a Hog, whoſe image they in a manner bear. And without troubling my ſelfe any further with bringing in Inſtances of this nature; you may have recourſe to the <hi>Phyſiognomiſts,</hi> who will furniſh you with
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:114719:109"/>good ſtore of them: by which you will be able to judge, how great the Vertue, and Power is of Reſemblance, and Figures.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. The Art of <hi>Divination of Dreames</hi> is alſo grounded upon Reſemblance, as may appear out of the Holy Bible;<note place="margin">Gen. <hi>40.</hi>
                     </note> where <hi>Joſeph</hi> foretold the Cupbearer, that within three dayes he ſhould be reſtored to his office a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: becauſe he had dreamed, that he preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed three cluſters of grapes into <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Cup. But he foretold the Baker, that after three dayes he ſhould be hanged, and his Fleſh ſhould be eaten by the birds of the Air; becauſe that He alſo had dreamed, that he bare three baskets full; and that the birds eat up all that was in them. He foretold alſo the ſeven years of Plenty, and the ſeven years of dearth, by the ſeven Fat Kine, and the ſeven Lean Ones; and by the ſeven Full ears of Corn, and the ſeven Thin ones; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> had dreamed. Prophane Hiſtories alſo affoard us many Examples of this kind, proving the power of Similitudes. For <hi>Hecuba,</hi> being with Child, dreamed that ſhe was delivered of a Firebrand, which burnt up her Kingdome: and this was <hi>Paris,</hi> who was afterwards the cauſe of the burning of <hi>Troy</hi> down to the ground. I ſhall here adde moreover, that this Reſemblance of Dreames hath oftentimes been ſo powerfull,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:114719:110"/>as that, what one hath dreamed, he hath afterward ſeen really come to paſſe. Thus <hi>Cornelius Ruffus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Plin. lib. <hi>7.</hi> c. <hi>50.</hi>
                     </note> dreaming that he had loſt his ſight, became ſhortly after quite blind. A like ſtory to this is related by <hi>Galen,</hi> in his book, <hi>De Praeſag. ex Inſomn.</hi> And the Reader may have recourſe to thoſe Authors, that have written of this Subject; as <hi>Nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorus, Salomon Judaeus, Syneſius, Plato, Cicero, Valerius Maximus, Cardan,</hi> and <hi>Artemidorus;</hi> who have examined all that <hi>Chryſippus, Antipater, Artemones, Jambli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus, Ariſtides, Apomazar</hi> the Arabian, and <hi>Scirnachan</hi> the Indian have ſaid concerning this Particular.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. <hi>Painting</hi> and <hi>Sculpture</hi> do alſo won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully confirme this Power of Figures; for as much as thoſe that are Sad, and Wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Pieces, do make us ſo ſad, as that they ſometimes draw Tears from our Eyes; and the Merry, and Cheerfull Pieces, make us Joyfull, and cauſe us to laugh. And this is the reaſon, why theſe Later are very ſeldom made uſe of in Holy matters; and the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Sort are ſo Frequent in our Churches, where we ſhall oftner find <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> pictu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on the Croſſe, then Riſing from the Dead; or, Sitting at the right hand of his Father: becauſe that, beſides that the Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him in that Poſture, puts us in mind
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:114719:110"/>both of our Redemption, and of his Love towards us, who being Immortall, would yet become Man, that ſo he might be in a Capacity to Die for Us; it alſo moves us, by the Vertue of Reſemblance, to be ſad, as It is: ſo great is the power it hath over us. <hi>Eſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim Similitudo,</hi> ſaith <hi>Porta, pictus ſermo, vel pictura loquens, quae quovis ſermone, quibuſve notis Valentior eſt.</hi>

Laſtly, the ſecret Vertues of Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance, and of Figures, appear as well in <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke,</hi> as in any other of the Sciences. Thus it is ſtoried of <hi>Timotheus</hi> the Muſician, that by the Diverſity of Voices, and Tones, which he ordered according to the ſeverall kinds of Humors, he was able to raiſe up in a man any ſort of Paſſion that he pleaſed. And we find by daily Experience,<note place="margin">Vid. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nec. lib. <hi>3.</hi> de Ira, c. <hi>9.</hi> Plin. l. <hi>28.</hi> c. <hi>2.</hi> Corn.

                     </note> that Merry ſongs make Us Merry, and ſad ones, make us Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly. The Muſick of the <hi>Lydians,</hi> as <hi>Plato</hi> reports, being very Effeminate, made the Hearers alſo Effeminate: on the contrary, that of the <hi>Phrygians</hi> made men Couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, Manlike, and Undaunted. I ſhall not here ſet downe, what ſome have delivered, of the Power that Muſick hath in the Curing of Diſeaſes, only by the Harmony, and Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable mixture of Tones; as it is reported of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> who is ſaid to have cured Mad men; as <hi>Terpander</hi> did, thoſe that were Deaf;
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:114719:111"/>and <hi>Damon,</hi>

As for Muſicall Inſtruments, it is moſt Certain, that we may make diverſe of them ſound to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, without touching them; provided that they be all Exactly Tuned to the ſame Pitch, and Tone, that That other is, which a man ſhall play on: And although the ſound of the others will be very Faint, and hardly percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable to the ſenſe; yet you ſhall plainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Motion that the Strings do make, if you lay but a feather, or ſome other ſuch light thing upon them. How Admirable then is this Reſemblance, which doth every where produce ſuch wonderfull Effects! <hi>Quidnam hîc efficit,</hi> ſaith <hi>Marſilius Ficinus, ut Cithara ſubitò patiatur à Cithara, niſi ſitus aliquis, et quaedam Figura conformis?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If then Reſemblance hath ſo great Power, in all thoſe things which we have now ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; we may very ſafely conclude, that it can have no leſſe in that of <hi>Taliſmanicall Figures;</hi> and this we may be the more Confident of, ſince we are confirmed herein by Experience it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>It now remaines, that we prove this Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to be Naturall, by the Third means which we propoſed; namely, by the Vertue of the Stars. And this we ſhall very eaſily be able to doe, after we have firſt ſhewed the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, which the more Learned ſort do ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:114719:111"/>in preparing theſe Images: I ſay, the more Learned ſort; becauſe I know very wel, that many are not ſo Accurate in their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations; as we ſhall ſhew hereafter; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they doe notwithſtanding ſometimes find the Effect anſwer their deſires; but it is, after a longer time, then otherwiſe it would be.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. Firſt of all then, they uſually propoſe to themſelves, what Effect they would have theſe Images produce; whether to chaſe away ſome Hurtfull Beaſts; or, to allay the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of Winds; to prevent Lightnings, and Haile; to cure certain Diſeaſes, and the like. This being firſt propoſed, they then ſearch after the Meanes, that may be proper for the attaining to the End Propoſed: as, for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, for the Cure of the Dropſie, it is to be conſidered, that the Diſeaſe conſiſts in Moiſture: they are therefore not to take any Matter indifferently, for to ingrave, and forme, under ſuch and ſuch Conſtellations; but it muſt be ſomething, that is of a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance Naturally Hot, and Dry. Secondly, they muſt take, for the Aſcendent, ſome Sign that is likewiſe Hot and Dry; as <hi>Aries,</hi> for inſtance, is ſaid to be. In the Third place, they muſt make choyce of ſome Starre, to which this Malady is ſubject; ſuch as <hi>Saturne</hi> is ſaid to be: but there being need alſo of ſome
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:114719:112"/>Starre that is very moyſt, (to the end that Sympathy, which is ſo powerfull in all things, may aſſiſt alſo in this particular;) they may take the <hi>Moon</hi> in her Wane. For, as the Curing of the Biting of a Viper, they mixe ſome of Its fleſh, with the Antidote; in like manner, for the expelling of theſe Wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh Humors, we muſt make uſe of that Star, which hath the greateſt Affinity with the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. You muſt alſo obſerve the Sign, which relates to the part of the body that is ill-affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted: and this is the Counſell of a learned Phyſician,<note place="margin">Parcelſ. in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gram.</note> who ſaies, that; <hi>Oportet Medicum abſque defectu ſcire, ubi cauda Draconis ſit in homine, ubi Aries, ubi Axis Polaris, ubi ſit linea Meridionalis, ubi Oriens, ubi Occi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,</hi> &amp;c. Now that the Signes have more Agreement with, and have ſtronger Influence upon one part of the body, then another; we are certainly taught by daily Experience, in the curing of Wounds. We muſt alſo have regard, if it be poſſible, to the Stars to which the Sicke perſon is ſubject: and then in the laſt place, we muſt above all things take care to begin our Work, under ſome certaine Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects, which are only uſeful in the Operation, ſome for to ſhed their Influences with more Heat, or Cold; and others, with leſſe; as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ſhall require. So that all things being thus diligently obſerved, the Beames of the
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:114719:112"/>Stars, finding a Figure aptly diſpoſed for the receiving them, do make ſuch an Impreſſion in it, by the Reſemblance and Harmony that they there find, as that being once taken in, they doe afterwards Operate on that which they finde to be ſemblable. In all the other Operations, they proceede after the ſame manner: as, for Example, to chaſe away Scorpions out of any place, they take the Signe, with which they have ſome Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence; ſuch as is the Signe <hi>Scorpio:</hi> then doe they take ſome Malignant ſtarre, which is Adverſe to them; it being not ſo neceſſary to obſerve ſo many rules in Beaſts, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Irrationall Creatures, as in Men. Now when the Figure of a Scorpion is thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, the Living Scorpions feeling natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally the Offenſive Influence, wherewith the Image is indued; they preſently avoid the place, for their owne preſervation; or elſe, if they be too neare it, they preſently dye. If it be thought by any a Hard thing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, how theſe Living Creatures ſhould have any ſenſe of this Influence; let them but conſider, that there are ſome Perſons that beare ſo ſtrange a hatred to Cats, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like Beaſts, as that if there be any with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the houſe where they are, they doe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently fall into a Sweating, and Trembling, although they ſee them not. It is reported
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:114719:113"/>alſo, that there is a certain Hearb, that Cats will ſent at a very great diſtance: inſomuch that, if one lay it upon the top of a Houſe, or in a Chamber, you ſhall have them come from very far, to tumble, and roule them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on it. Many things are delivered by the Naturaliſts, which are in appearance much more Incredible then Theſe. It there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now remains only, that I anſwer three Doubts which are propoſed; namely, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Starres have any Influence upon things here below, or not? Whether they have any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance with them?</hi> And, <hi>Whether Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Figures can retaine their Influences, and afterwards Operate by them?</hi> as we have ſaid.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. But firſt of all I muſt lay down this, for a moſt certain Concluſion, and Foundation; <hi>That the Stars, and their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences in theſe Figures, have no Power at all over our Wills.</hi> And therefore do I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, as Ridiculous, Damnable, and Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous, thoſe Operations, which <hi>Albinus Villanovenſis</hi> ſaies, may be effected by means of theſe Images:<note place="margin">In Magia Aſtr.</note>

As, when <hi>Albinus Villanovenſis</hi> ſaies, that for to cure the Tertian, and Quartan Ague, the pain of the Nerves, Ventricle, and Privy parts, you muſt grave the Image of a Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion upon a piece of Gold, or Silver, when the <hi>Sun</hi> is in his proper Houſe, and the <hi>Moone</hi> in Capricorne: and while you are graving it, you muſt ſay theſe words: <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urge Domine, gloria mea; Exurge Pſalteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, &amp; Cithara; exurgam diluculò:</hi> and then rehearſe this Pſalme; <hi>Miſerere mei Deus, miſerere mei; quia in te confidit anima mea.</hi>
                     <pb n="188" facs="tcp:114719:115"/>From hence it is, that ſo many Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have ſprung; and that people at length begun to undertake the curing of Diſeaſed perſons, meerly by the bare Reciting of Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Words; without any regard had, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Stars, or any thing elſe. Let us now come to the Firſt <hi>Quaere</hi> which we are to prove, for the Eſtabliſhing of the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Figures: namely, <hi>Whether the Starres have any Influence upon, and doe cauſe any Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in things here below.</hi>

                     <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> endeavouring to prove the Affirmative, brings a moſt Excellent Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and worthy of ſo great a Philoſopher; which is this. That, ſaith He, from whom Motion took its beginning, the ſame hath no doubt given to all other things the Power of Self-motion: now, without all Diſpute, the Motion of the Heavens was the Firſt in Nature; therefore, whatſoever Moves, Moves by the Motion of the Heavens. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch, that if the Motion of theſe ſhould ceaſe, both Growth, and Motion would alſo ceaſe in all things here below.<note place="margin">In Sphoer. Sacr. c. <hi>3.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Junctin</hi> brings here an Example of a Man's heart; which, as it is the beginning of Life, and Motion, ſo doth it communicate Life, and Motion to all the reſt of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: So that, if it once be wounded, not onely the Motion ceaſeth in all the parts
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:114719:115"/>of he body, but even Life alſo. You may ſee this Poſition confirmed by <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates,</hi> who backs it with ſo many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,<note place="margin">Lib. de Aëre &amp; Aquis.</note> and ſo ſtrongly aſſerts the truth of theſe Celeſtiall Influences, as that he confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently affirmes, that, by the riſing and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Starres, a man may foretell Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts, raine, Stormes, and other changes of weather: through the neglect of which Obſervations, Phyſitians are very often deceived in their Cures and Diſeaſes. <hi>Cùm temporum mutationes,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>&amp; Aſtrorum ortus &amp; occaſus obſervaverit medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus, quemadmodum ſingula horum eveniant, praenoſcit utique &amp; de anno, qualis hic ſit fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turus, &amp;c.</hi> And then, afterwards ſhewing, what time, and what Seaſons are dangerous for Sick People, by reaſon of the diverſe motions of the Starres, he preſently addes: <hi>Periculoſiſsima ſunt ambo Solſtitia, maximè verò aeſtivum periculoſum: etiam Aequinocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um utrumque, magis verò Autumnale. Opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tet autem &amp; Aſtrorum ortus conſiderare, prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipuè Canis: deinde Arcturi, &amp; Plejadum occaſum: Morbi enim in his maximè diebus judicantur, aliique perimunt, alij verò deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunt, aut in aliam ſpeciem, aliumque ſtatum tranſmutantur.</hi> It would be but loſt time, if I ſhould ſtand longer upon the Proof of this ſo clear a Truth; which all men ought
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:114719:116"/>to confeſſe to be ſo, were there no other Argument for it, but this; that it hath been conſtantly obſerved, ever ſince the firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Aſtronomy in the World, that the Riſing and Setting of the Fixed Starres have been the cauſe of very great changes here on Earth: and he muſt either be a very Ridiculous, ſenſeleſſe man, or elſe a very Ignorant, that ſhould go about to deny, that the <hi>Hyades,</hi> and the <hi>Plejades,</hi> are not Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, Cloudy Conſtellations; that is to ſay, do cauſe Rainy, Cloudy, Darks weather: as <hi>Leo,</hi> and the <hi>Dog-ſtarre,</hi> bring Heat, and Drowth: and <hi>Orion,</hi> a Wet, and tempeſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſeaſon: and ſo of the reſt. And after all,<note place="margin">Vid. Gul. Rovill. hiſt. Plant.</note> do we not obſerve, that there are ſome certain Flowers, that turn about as the Sun does: and others, that appear above the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at his Riſing; and when He ſets, ſinke downe againe, and hide themſelves, as it were bewayling his abſence? Neither are the Influences of the Stars ſhed upon Hearbs alone, but even upon Stones alſo: Some wherof do ſo exactly obſerve the motion of thoſe particular Starres, whoſe Influences they bear, as that they change their Aſpects with them. An Example of this Truth you have in the Stone called <hi>Lunaria,</hi> which is indued with ſuch wonderfull qualities, as that it changeth its Appearance, in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:114719:116"/>as the Moon doth, whoſe name it bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth. In a word, do not the Humours in our bodies increaſe, with this Planet, and decreaſe, when It decreaſeth? If any man yet deſire to have more of theſe Inſtances, backed with Convincing Reaſons; he may have recourſe to the Aſtronomicall Praedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of <hi>Ptolomy:</hi> and he ſhall there finde, that the truth of theſe Influences is too clear, to be called in queſtion.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. The other Point, concerning the Reſemblance of the Heavenly Conſtellations to Sublunary things, is ſomething more Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to prove, though not leſſe True: Nevertheleſſe this objection is brought againſt it. If the Conſtellations of the <hi>Ramme,</hi> the <hi>Bull,</hi> the <hi>Twins,</hi> &amp;c. do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble theſe Living Creatures; it is either Really, or elſe by Imagination. If Really; they are then, either in the Eighth Sphear, or elſe in ſome other: but they are not in the Eighth. For, in the Conſtellations of the <hi>Ramme,</hi> the <hi>Bull,</hi> &amp;c. there is no ſigne at all of theſe Beaſts being figured, or repreſented by the Stars: neither are they in the Chriſtaline Heaven; nor yet in any of the Sphears of the Planets: for we ſhould then ſee them, as we do the other Starres: nor yet in a Ninth Heaven; as ſome have thought. If they are only by Imagination, then are their Effects
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:114719:117"/>alſo Imaginary, and have no Truth in them; and ſo, by conſequence, the Power of <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſmans,</hi> or Figures, is Vaine.</p>
                  <p>We anſwere then, according to the Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the moſt learned <hi>Aſtrologers,</hi> that in truth theſe Images are not at all Reall: for in the Starres that make up the Conſtellation of the <hi>Ramme,</hi> a man may as well fancy a Horſe there, as a Sheep; as I have ſometimes made triall. Neither yet are they altogether Imaginary, in the ſame ſenſe as a <hi>Chimera</hi> is Imaginary, which never had Being in Nature: but they are ſo ordered in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens by our Imagination, becauſe that the Conſtellation which we call <hi>Aries,</hi> or the <hi>Ramme,</hi> hath a ſtrong Influence upon ſheep; as <hi>Taurus</hi> hath upon Buls; and ſo of the reſt. Or elſe the Celeſtiall <hi>Ramme</hi> is ſo called, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is not any beaſt upon the Earth, that is more like in Nature to this Conſtel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, then the <hi>Ramme:</hi> For it renders him that is born vnder it ſo Pious, ſo Meek, ſo Gentle, ſo Courteous, that he reſembleth in all things the Innocent Lambe. He will alſo have a Hard Head, and thick Haire, curled in rings,<note place="margin">Iusphaer. c. <hi>2.</hi>
                     </note> like a fleece of Wooll. <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimus enim</hi> (ſaith <hi>Junctin</hi>) <hi>complures hujus ſigni homines, capite malliari, Spiſsis crinibus ad modum velleris, &amp; ſupra frontem elevatis, quaſi capite certarent.</hi> And theſe are the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:114719:117"/>reaſons, why theſe Celeſtiall Signes are called by the names of Living Creatures. One may adde to this, with <hi>Junctin,</hi> that when the Moon is in the Signe of <hi>Aries,</hi> this Signe hath then the ſtronger Influence upon the Head of Man, and renders it ſtrong as that of this Beaſt: and this may be another reaſon, why this Conſtellation is called by the name of this beaſt, rather then of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. So in like manner, when the ſame Planet is in the Signe of <hi>Taurus,</hi> it hath a ſtronger Influence upon the Neck; wherein conſiſts the chiefeſt ſtrength of a <hi>Bull:</hi> when it is in <hi>Gemini,</hi> the Influence is ſtrong up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Armes; and for this cauſe, this Signe is repreſented by the Image of two children, embracing one another: When it is in the <hi>Crab,</hi> the Breaſt is then ſharer in its Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences; becauſe that this Creature alwayes goeth upon its Breaſt: and when it is in <hi>Leo,</hi> the Signe ſheds its Influence upon the Heart; from whence the Lion is ſaid to be a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and Couragious beaſt. You may ſee the reſt of this diſcourſe, in the ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor; which I ſhall not here trouble my ſelfe to ſet down, becauſe the reaſons do not at all ſatisfie me. I do therefore beleeve, that theſe Signes do caſt forth their influences upon the ſeverall Members of the body, though not for theſe Reaſons here delivered;
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:114719:118"/>which often prove to be very Impertinent; but onely, becauſe we dayly ſee the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of it. They do therefore viſibly work by their Influences, upon thoſe Beaſts, whoſe names they are called by: for, Dogs run mad, in the Dog-dayes; and Lions are very furious, under the Signe of <hi>Leo:</hi> and this was the Only Reaſon, which moved the Firſt Philoſophers to call theſe Conſtel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, by the names of theſe beaſts: and all the other reaſons that are brought, are but of Later ſtanding, and have been inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Later Aſtrologers. Theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellations then are called by the names of theſe Living Creatures, becauſe that they are obſerved to have great power over them. And that I may trouble my ſelfe no further in this Particular, you may ſee the Abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all that <hi>Junctin</hi> hath written hereof, in <hi>Heurnius,</hi>

<pb n="195" facs="tcp:114719:118"/>to defend the Power of Figures, have ſaid, that the Signes of the Zodiack only are of power to Worke Effectually, and General<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; foraſmuch as they make their Circuit, or at leaſt the Sun in them, over the whole Earth;<note place="margin">Albu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maz. in Mag.

                     </note> whereas the others reſpect but one Part only. Notwithſtanding we could very well be able to give an account of all of them; as I ſhall ſhew at another time, if I ſee that This Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe find but favourable acceptance among the Learned; and I ſhall alſo diſcover the Principall Reaſons, which have hitherto lain hid under Fables, why the Ancient A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrologers impoſed ſuch Extravagant Names, as they ſeemed to be, upon all the reſt of thoſe Conſtellations. At this preſent I ſhall only content my ſelfe in ſhewing, how thoſe of the Zodiack may have power to Operate upon Figures framed by Art: and this is the Third Point, which I have undertaken to prove.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. The Queſtion then is, <hi>Whether the Starres doe ſhed their Influences, as well on Artificiall, as Naturall Things, or not?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, in two words,<note place="margin">Contra gent. li. <hi>3.</hi> &amp; lib. de Fato. In ſpecul. &amp; de Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rab. tract. <hi>3.</hi> c. <hi>4.</hi> &amp; <hi>5.</hi>
                     </note> that the Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive is ſo Certainly True, that neither <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Aquinas,</hi> (who left nothing unexamined in this Queſtion,) nor <hi>Albertus Magnus</hi> could poſſibly deny it. And even Experience teacheth us, that the Sun warmeth as well
<pb n="961" facs="tcp:114719:119"/>the Artificiall Image of a Man, as the Man himſelfe: now, if this Planet work indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon Both, why ſhould not the reſt doe ſo too? In a word, why ſhould not the Stars as well Operate on Artificiall, as on Naturall things; ſeeing that, in their Eſſence, they are All Natural? Should we exclude Gold from the number of things Natural, becauſe it is faſhioned into a Ring? And are Stones rendered leſſe Natural, when they are framed into a Houſe? If it be objected, that, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, they ſhould not acquire thereby More Vertue, then they had before. I anſwer, that the Contrary is manifeſtly proved by two Reaſons. The firſt is, becauſe that the different Figure renders them more apt to O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, to ſuch, or ſuch an Action, then they were before: as for Example, if a piece of Wood, or Stone, were unapt to hold water, by making of it Hollow, it preſently becomes Fit for ſuch a purpoſe: and ſo in other Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures. The other Reaſon is; that theſe things, when they come under the Worke-man's hands, are wrought under certain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellations; which communicate ſuch Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences and Qualities unto them, as they never had before: as we ſee by Experience in Bisket bread; one ſort whereof will keep a very long time, and the other, that was baked either before, or after it, will be ſubject to Wormes,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:114719:119"/>and Corruption, although kept in the ſame place, and made of the ſame Corne, and knea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded up with the ſame water, and with all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther imaginable conditions. But, to keepe our ſelves to the buſineſſe of Figures only, we ſhall here conclude; that, if they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, with all theſe Circumſtances obſerved, which we have before delivered, and ingraven upon ſome Matter that is Proper for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of the Influences of the Starres; they may Naturally retaine them, and work thoſe wonderfull Effects, which we have before ſet downe.

But when they perceived, that Knowing Men would hardly ſit downe ſo; and that it concerned them to produce ſome Reaſons, to prove that theſe Figures can have no Naturall Power at all; they have at length brought Theſe following ones; though they are built on very weake foundations, as we ſhall make it appeare.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Firſt is, that Reaſon it ſelfe tels us, that theſe Operations cannot be Totally Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, but rather ſuperſtitious and Dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; ſeeing that, to reduce them to a full, and entire Effect, there are ſome certaine words to be uſed; which have no Power at all, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally over things which have no Senſe; and that Therefore, the Making of them ought to be forbidden, and rejected, as the Church hath ordained.</p>
                  <pb n="201" facs="tcp:114719:121"/>
                  <p>To anſwer fully, and in Order, both to This Objection, and to the reſt that follow, I ſay; that, in the Firſt place, we are to take notice; that, in the matter of theſe Figures, we have already condemned all Words, and all other Superſtitions: ſo that, to avoid a Tedious Repetition, the Reader muſt call to mind, what hath already been ſaid to This. As for the Church, it never yet rejected the True, and Lawfull Power of Figures, ſuch as we have deſcribed it: as may appeare out of the Writings of thoſe two Learned Men, <hi>Tho. Aquinas,</hi> and Cardinall <hi>Cajetan.</hi> And if the Fathers have ſometimes condemned it; it was not till they ſaw that it was ſo mixed with ſuperſtition (that I ſay not, Abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) that they conceived they ſhould never o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe be able to divert men from the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of it, but by condemning it utterly: as <hi>Moſes</hi> likewiſe did, in forbidding abſolutely the Graffing on a Tree of a different kind, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to keep them from that ſinne, which was uſually committed at that Action; as we ſhall ſhew hereafter. And that it may appear that the bare Figures have not been uſed alwayes, without any Application of Words and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies; ſuch as were not only Vaine, but Ridiculous alſo; we may take notice, that in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> when they would cauſe Haile to ceaſe, which might have been effected by the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:114719:122"/>Vertue of a bare <hi>Taliſman</hi> onely; it was thought Neceſſary, that Foure Naked Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſhould lye along upon the ground on their backs; and lifting up their feet on high, they were to pronounce ſome certaine words, and ſo the Haile would ceaſe. <hi>Quatuor Muli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eres</hi> (ſaid they, as R. <hi>Moſes</hi> reports,) <hi>jaceant in terra ſuper dorſum ſuum nudae, et erigant pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des ſuos, et dicant talia verba, et operentur i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtud: grando, deſcendens ſuper locum illum, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedet ab eodem loco.</hi> This Ridiculous Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony was taken from the Poſture of ſome <hi>Taliſmanicall Figure,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">In Gen.</note> which ſerved to divert ſtormes of Haile; whereon, ſaith <hi>Chomer,</hi> was graven the Image of <hi>Venus</hi> lying along. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, ſome Ignorant perſons having lighted upon ſome of the Characters, which the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients had invented, that ſo they might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale their Philoſophical Secrets, from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Rabble; (ſuch as are thoſe wherewith the Chymiſts bookes are full:) not knowing the Originall of them, and believing that they had ſome ſecret Vertue in them, they graved them on <hi>Taliſmans.</hi> Such perhaps was the Aegyptians <hi>Serapis,</hi> which had on its breaſt the ſo much Celebrated Letter <hi>Tau.</hi> This inſcribing of Cifres, and Characters, brought alſo along with it this Beliefe; that ſeeeing there were Letters written upon <hi>Taliſmans,</hi> they might certainly then be read alſo: and
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:114719:122"/>hence did this Superſtition take Riſe, of ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Words in the making of theſe Figures; and afterwards, of letting alone the Figures, and uſing the bare Words only: as it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of <hi>Trallianus,</hi>

And <hi>Homer</hi> writes, that the bleeding of <hi>Uliſſes</hi> his wound was ſtopped, by uſing certaine Words: as likewiſe that of <hi>Oroondates</hi> was, in <hi>Heliodorus;</hi> who, with <hi>Strabo,</hi> affirmes, that the Indians, and Ethiopians, uſe no other way of curing their Diſeaſes. <hi>Froiſſart</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures us, that he hath ſeen theſe Ceremonies practiſed in His time: and even in Our dayes they are uſed but too often, eſpecially by Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious Women. But at laſt there were ſome that made more Eſteeme of Characters, then of Plain Words, conſidering with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves what the power of Figures was. Thus <hi>Pliny</hi> reports,<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>28.</hi> cap. <hi>2.</hi>
                     </note> that <hi>M.

To conclude, theſe things having been invented only for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing of ſome Secrets, as we have ſaid,<note place="margin">De ſecret. Oper. Art. &amp; Nat. cap. 1,</note> (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Roger Bacon,</hi> who ſaith, <hi>Quae Philoſophi

                  <p n="2">2. Now that the Practice of making theſe Figures was never forbidden, but only to keepe us off from thoſe Abominations, that were uſually hereby committed, (the Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being nevertheleſſe Naturall, as wee have ſhewed; and the Things themſelves having beene very Innocently uſed by Good Men, without the aſſiſtance of any other Power, ſave that of Nature;) wee may perceive by a like Example, in the Command that was given, of not Graffing on a tree of a Different kind. For it was given for no other Reaſon, (that I may here paſſe by thoſe, which are brought by Interpreters, both Greeke and Latine, which are many times very wide of the Text) but only to turne away the Jewes from thoſe Filthineſſes, and Abominations, which they uſually committed at this kind of Engraffing. The Latine words will in ſome ſort hide the Uncleanneſſe of the diſcourſe of theſe Villanies: you ſhall have them therefore out
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:114719:123"/>of the above-named <hi>Rabbi Moſes,</hi> a man of very great knowledge in theſe Traditions: <hi>Dixerunt ergò, quòd in horâ quâ inſeritur una ſpecies in aliam,</hi>

For, if a Whore planted an Olive Tree, (ſaith one of the Learnedeſt Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates of <hi>France,</hi> according to the Opinion of the Naturaliſts,) it would never beare any Fruit. <hi>Oliva,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>a Meretrice plantata, vel infructuoſa perpetuò manet, vel omninò areſcit.</hi> Now,<note place="margin">Gul.

                     </note> to Engraffe any Tree what ever, is a thing both Naturall, and of it ſelf Indifferent: nevertheleſſe it was forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, meerly to avoid the Sin which Nature abhors. <hi>Propter hoc igitur,</hi> is the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the fore-cited Jew, <hi>prohibitae fuerune commixtiones, ſcilicet inciſio arboris in aliam ſpeciem, ut elongemur à cauſis Idolatriae, &amp; fornicationum.</hi> And the like cauſe hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo moved thoſe men, that have condemned Figures; though They are both Naturall, and the making of them Lawfull; as we
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:114719:124"/>have already ſhewed. Now the reaſon, why they have been alſo rejected by ſome of the more Learned ſort, was either to give way to the Rigour of the <hi>Inquiſition;</hi> as the <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talians,</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> have done: or elſe, for want of having taken the paines to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine them; as <hi>Gul.

                  <p n="3">3. The Second Objection is grounded upon the Fooliſhneſſe, and Impertinence of the words that are uſed about theſe <hi>Taliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans;</hi> at the making whereof, Ignorant peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple doe ſtill uſe ſome certain Words, which, ſay they, are very neer bordering upon I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry.</p>
                  <p>But we have already anſwered, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent Chapter, that we doe not at all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Follies of the Superſtitious; but do rather freely condemn Their Obſervations, and all words, that tend to Superſtition. In the ſame Chapter alſo we have rejected part of the Fooleries, delivered by <hi>Villanovenſis:</hi> and, that we may not have any Scruple un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied, we doe alſo here condemn thoſe, which are brought by <hi>Antonius Mizaldus:</hi> as namely,<note place="margin">Cent.

For, beſides that the Manner of making them is Ridiculous, it is alſo as far different from the true way that is to be obſerved in making them, as Hell is from Heaven. So that I cannot much wonder at the Ill Luck of a Friend of mine; who ſaies, that of above a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of theſe <hi>Taliſmans</hi> that he had made, according to theſe Vaine Rules here deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, he never ſaw any One of them an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer his Expectation. But I deſiring him
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:114719:125"/>to make one, according to the Directions I gave him; he preſently ſaw the Effect fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. And <hi>M. Sanclarus,</hi> (the Learned <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius Profeſſor</hi> in the <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> who is yet living, and may be askt the Queſton,) hath ſworn to me, that he hath cured a moſt Intollerable Paine in the Reins, by one of theſe true <hi>Taliſmans:</hi> ſo much doth it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne us to be able to diſtinguiſh, betwixt the True, and Falſe ones. We reject there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Foppiſh Way of making them, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by the ſaid <hi>Mizaldus,</hi> as well in the places above-cited, as in ſome others: as namely in the 44. <hi>&amp;</hi> 93. <hi>Aphoriſmes</hi> of the Second Century; the 98. <hi>Aphoriſme</hi> of the Third Century; and the 47. Aphoriſme of the Ninth: in which places he makes uſe of words both vain, and Superſtitious, and alſo of moſt Falſe Principles: which is the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why no man could ever, by uſing them, attaine to the End he propoſed. Now I have formerly ſaid, that we condemne all Figures and Words, that are mixed with Superſtition, in theſe <hi>Taliſmanicall Figures</hi> only: for, as for thoſe Ceremonies &amp; words, which are piouſly uſed; as for example, to cauſe a Storme of Haile to ceaſe; a man may uſe them without any ſuſpicion at all, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Judgement of ſome Divines. The manner is thus deſcribed by <hi>Wierus.</hi>
                     <pb n="210" facs="tcp:114719:126"/>Having firſt made the ſigne of the Croſſe,<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>4.</hi> de praeſtig. Daem.</note> againſt the Lightning, Haile, Thunder, or Tempeſt, you muſt take three Haileſtones, of thoſe that firſt fell, and caſt them into the fire, in the name of the Holy Trinity; and having repeated the Lords Prayer two or three times over, you muſt read the Goſpel of S. <hi>John:</hi> which being ended, you muſt make the ſigne of the Croſſe, over againſt the Cloud, and the Thunder, on every ſide; &amp; make the ſame alſo upon the ground, toward the foure quarters of the World: and after that the <hi>Exorciſt</hi> ſhall have ſaid three times, <hi>Verbum caro factum eſt,</hi> adding to it as often theſe words; <hi>Per Evangelica dicta fugiat tempeſtas iſta;</hi> if the Tempeſt were raiſed out of malice, ſaith <hi>Wierus,</hi> it will ceaſe. But let us leave the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this matter till ſome other time; one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerving at preſent, that there hath crept in Superſtition Here alſo, as well as into the Buſineſſe, we now treat of.</p>
                  <p>The Third Objection is grounded, upon the Impotency of the Matter Ingraved. For, how can an Image, which is dead, and without Motion, give Motion to others, and have ſuch Operations,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> as are attributed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it? Thus it is argued by <hi>Gulielmus Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſienſis,</hi> againſt theſe Figures. <hi>Quomodo Imago mortua, et omni modo inapprehenſa,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:114719:126"/>omnique modo immobilis, moveret viventes? out qualiter praeſtat Scientiam, quam nec ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buit, nec actu, nec potentia eam habet certiſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum eſt? Gerſon</hi> ſayes the ſame, and brings in a manner, all the very ſame Arguments, in a Booke that he hath written againſt a certain Phyſitian of <hi>Montpelier,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lib. pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liari duo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dec. pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſ.</note> who gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon a piece of Gold, the Image of a Lion, for the Cure of the Stone.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. To this I anſwere, that the Image of It ſelfe, is dead, and without any Motion: but that by the Vertue of the Stars, under which it was made, it hath acquired new Qualities, which it had not before: or elſe, that the Matter being before indued with ſome Qualities that were Proper for ſuch an Effect, it is diſpoſed for ſuch an Effect by a Semblable Figure, and its Qualities are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited. <hi>Itaque ars,</hi> ſaith <hi>Marcilius Ficinus,</hi>

                     <hi>ſuſcitat inchoatam ibi virtutem, ac dum ad figuram redigit, ſimilem ſuae cuidam coeleſti figurae, tunc ſuae illic ideae prorſus expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit; quam ſic expoſitam Coelum ea perficit virtute qua caeperat, exhibens quaſi ſulphuri flammam.</hi> Thus many things, if they are not excited, work not at all: as for Inſtance, to make ſome Hearbs to ſmell, you muſt cruſh them betwixt your fingers. So <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> which hath received from the Heavens, the Property of drawing Strawes to it; yet
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:114719:127"/>unleſſe it be a while rubbed, and chafed, it is not able to do it. The <hi>Bezaar,</hi> or <hi>Bezohar</hi> Stone, (which <hi>Marcilius Ficinus</hi> ſayes, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies as much as, <hi>A morte liberans:</hi> though this be an Etymologie as Vnknown, as Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true:) which is Naturally indued with the Power of Expelling Poyſon, becomes alſo a very Soveraigne Remedy againſt it. That of the Scorpion, if there be firſt graved on it the Figure of a Scorpion, under the Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Celeſtiall Conſtellation of the ſame name. The Flint Stone gives not its Fire, unleſſe you ſtrike it: in a word, there is ſcarcely any thing, but requires to be Excited, and Awakened up to its worke; even as low, as Artificiall things; many wherof appear not at all, unleſſe there be Art uſed to diſcover them: as we may ſee, for Example, in Letters written with the juyce of <hi>Citrons, Figs, Onyons, Salt Almo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicke,</hi> and many other things; which muſt be either held before the Fire, or elſe dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in Water, that they may be read. In like manner alſo is it Neceſſary, that the Vertue of Metals, and of Stones, ſhould be excited by the Celeſtiall Raies, for the Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering them Apt to effect that which we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. Now that theſe Raies are ſo Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, as that they are able to penetrate Stones, and into the bowels of the Earth, we have
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:114719:127"/>already proved; and ſhall here confirme it, by the teſtimony of <hi>Bonaventure: Dicunt Philoſophi, quod corpus caeleſte, mediante ſuo lumine, influit uſque ad profundum ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rae, ubi mineralia corpora generari habent: et,</hi>

If then the Starres do operate, within the bowels of the Earth, upon Living Creatures, Plants, and Metals, why not upon Stones alſo? I do therefore account the Concluſion of <hi>Hieron. Hangeſt,</hi> an Ancient, Learned Sorboniſt, to be moſt True; who, ſearching after the Reaſon of <hi>Gamahes,</hi> concludes, (after a long diſpute;) that the Figure, or Painting on them, proceeds from two Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; from the Starres, and from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the Earth.<note place="margin">Lib. de cauſ. fol. <hi>88.</hi>
                     </note> See here his own words. <hi>Quid igitur diſcendum ſit? reſpondeo, ex du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plici radice poſſe contingere. Uno modo ex ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice Siderea, ſecundum Aſtrologorum autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatem, multis experimentis comprobatam. Alio modo, ex radice inferiore, &amp;c.</hi> Now this Power, or Vertue of the Starres, works Indifferently upon All Things; which Conſideration hath moved many, that ſtand up for the Power of Figures, to believe, that all ſorts of Stones, Metalls, or other Matter indifferently, if it be graved, and wrought,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:114719:128"/>according to the Rules before delivered, would worke the ſame Effect. For, as Fire heateth all things that are ſet before it; in like manner do the Stars Operate, ſay they, upon All Things Indifferently. But I hold the Firſt Opinion to be the Truer, and more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine: not, that this Later is Falſe; but, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Effect Here is Slower. For, the Fire will indeed heat all things, that are placed neare it: but if the Matter be Indiſpoſed, the Heat will not worke ſo ſpeedily: as we ſee in Green Wood; and in a Pibble ſtone, which requireth a longer time to grow hot in, then a Brick doth: and ſo in all other things. It is required then, to the end that the Stars may Operate the more Eaſily, and in leſſe time, that the Matter be before hand indued with ſome Quality, that is proper to the Effect which we have propoſed to our ſelves; and have alſo ſome Sympathy with thoſe Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall Signes, which we intend to make uſe of.</p>
                  <p>You may ſee this Sympathy, and the Wonderfull Correſpondence that there is, betwixt Stones, Mineralls, Herbs, Plants, Flowers, Taſts, Smels, Colours, Beaſts, Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes, Birds, and all things elſe, and the Stars,<note place="margin">Ton. <hi>4.</hi> Cant. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>31.</hi>

<pb n="216" facs="tcp:114719:129"/>what ever, is truly very Admirable.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Fourth Objection, which is brought by the above-named Authors, is; that if this Art of preparing Images be Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and their Vertue ſo great, as is ſaid; the <hi>Egyptians, Arabians,</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> who were the Firſt Inventers of them, would then have made themſelves Lords of the whole Earth, in ſubduing all their Enemies: which thing they have not done; but contrariwiſe have themſelves all been Conquered.</p>
                  <p>To this I anſwer, that no Image, or <hi>Taliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manicall Figure</hi> can poſſibly be Capable of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perating ſo Great an Effect: they may indeed poſſibly excite, in ſome ſmall meaſure, the courage of Combatants, and make them leſſe fearefull of the Terrors of Warre; but theſe Qualities alone will never be ſufficient, for the obtaining of a Victory. If any here urge againſt me the Story of <hi>Nectanabo,</hi> who is ſaid to have drowned all his Enemies Ships, by making certaine little Veſſels of Waxe, and then drowning Them: I anſwer, that the Story lookes very Doubtfully; neither doe I give any more Credit to it, then to thoſe Flams we heare reported of Sorcerers, in our owne daies, who are ſaid, by pricking a little Image of Waxe in any part of it, to wound the ſame part of the body in the perſon whom it repreſents. But ſuppoſe Theſe Things were
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:114719:129"/>ſo: yet it could not be from hence concluded, that theſe Effects were wrought by the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Stars; but rather by ſome Evill Angels, to whom God may have given ſome ſuch Power.<note place="margin">Lib. ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tato.</note> 
                     <hi>Gulielmus Pariſienſis</hi> utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies theſe ſtories to be True; as indeed they are meerly Fabulous: neither do I believe there is any one of them that hath any Truth it in. If it be returned upon us, that there is nothing in them, but a man may believe, ſince Poſſibly they Might be True: I anſwer, that Many Things Might have been, which never yet Haven been: as, for inſtance, there might have been more Sunnes, and more Worlds then one.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The Fift Objection is, that it is Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that Naturall Agents ſhould,<note place="margin">Ariſt. Phyſ. <hi>7.</hi>
                     </note> ſome way or other, Touch the thing they are to Operate upon: but a Figure, which cureth the Stone, Collicke, or any other Diſeaſe, toucheth not at all the Part Affected: the Vertue of it therefore cannot be Naturall.</p>
                  <p>The anſwer to this Objection is ſo eaſie, that,<note place="margin">Diſt. <hi>37.</hi> in Sent.</note> without troubling our ſelves to reckon up, with <hi>Scotus,</hi> the ſeverall wayes of <hi>Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> we need no more but give an Inſtance in a <hi>Hot Bricke.</hi> For as a Bricke receives heate from the Fire, without touching either Cole, or Flame; in like manner doth an Image re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Influence of the Stars, without Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Any Part of the Heavens. In a word,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:114719:130"/>all the Touching which is here found, is only a <hi>Virtuall Touching;</hi> as we ſee in the Sunne, which though it be ſo farre diſtant from the Earth, doth nevertheleſſe warme it by Its Vertue. And as a Bricke, heated either by the Sun, or by the Fire, doth afterwards ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate upon any other body, communicating its Vertue to it, if it be applied unto it: in the ſame manner doth a Figure, or Image ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate upon Another Body, communicating the Influences, which it hath received from the Stars, unto It, if it be in like manner ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, either by a Corporeall, or by a Virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Touching only. I ſhall not here produce the Miraculous Operation of the <hi>Weapon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalve,</hi> which cures a Wound, at a hundred Leagues diſtance, if it be but applied to the Weapon that made it; and that you dreſſe it, as you would doe the Wounded Perſon:<note place="margin">Tract. de <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngu. Armar. De <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ng. Magnet.</note> as it is proved by <hi>Rhodolphus Gochlenius,</hi> and <hi>Baptiſta Helmontius.</hi> If I ſhould have made uſe of this Example, I ſhould never have beene quiet from having it throwne in my Teeth, that the Operation of this <hi>Magneticall Unguent</hi> is Superſtitious, and Diabolicall. This is the whole Burden of the Ignorant Rabble, who impute, what ever they find to carry Wonder with it, to the Operation of Evill Spirits: and yet I have been aſſured by M. <hi>Loyſel,</hi> Phyſician to the late King of
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:114719:130"/>
                     <hi>France,</hi> that this very Operation was Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall; and that Himſelfe had made uſe of it, with Good Sacceſſe, and on a very Good Man. Now if <hi>Gulielmus Pariſienſis</hi> deny, that the Operation of a <hi>Taliſmanicall</hi> Image, which is buried under ground, can be Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall; becauſe that it is kept in by the Earth, which covers it: hee may as well conclude, that the Operation of a Needle touched with a Loadſtone is alſo Diabolicall; ſeeing that, although it be a hundred fathoms deep within the Earth, yet will it always turne it ſelf to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Pole. This Compariſon is ſo much the more Preſſing, becauſe that the moſt of the Learned believe, that this Vertue of the Load-ſtone is communicated unto it, by that part of the Heavens, which the Needle points to. So True it is, that there is nothing more Powerfull, then the Influences of the Stars, when they have once made an Impreſſion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on things here below.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The Sixt Objection ſtrikes at the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which we have attributed to Reſemblance: for, there is not any where (ſaith <hi>Guliel. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſienſis,</hi>) a nearer Tye, and Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, then in the Love of a Mother and her Child: and yet if a Mother drowne her ſelfe, the Child will not preſently do ſo too; and ſo he concludes: <hi>Quanto minus igitur in tam di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſis, ut ſunt Imago &amp; Imaginatum, nulla li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatura,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:114719:131"/>inter ea erit, quae cogat, ut quod pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur Imago, patiatur et Imaginatum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I know very well, that this Author makes uſe of this Argument againſt <hi>Nectanabo:</hi> but ſeeing that he brings it alſo againſt <hi>Taliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manicall Images,</hi> I anſwere; that theſe Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, (as wee have already ſaid) have no Power at all over our Wils. Now, to Drown Ones Selfe, or, Not to Drown ones Selfe, is an Action which depends wholly upon the Will. But if a Child reſemble the Mother, as well in the Lineaments of the Face, as in the Actions of the Soul; there is no doubt, but that this Reſemblance may have very much power, both as well on the Paſſions of the Minde, as on thoſe of the Body, which proceed from within: as it is often obſerved. And even in Our dayes, We have heard of two young Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, which were Brothers, at <hi>Riez,</hi> an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopall City in <hi>Provence</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> who by reaſon of their being ſo perfecty Like One Another, if One of them were ſicke, the Other was ſo too: as, for example, if One began to have a Pain in the Head, the Other would preſently feele it. If One of them were aſleep, or ſad; the other could not hold up his head, or be merry: and ſo of the reſt, as I have been aſſured by <hi>M. Poitevin,</hi> a very honeſt man, and a Native of the ſame city.</p>
                  <pb n="221" facs="tcp:114719:131"/>
                  <p n="8">8. The Seventh Objection, brought by the ſame <hi>Guliel. Pariſienſis, &amp; Gerſon,</hi> is, That if at any time theſe <hi>Taliſmanicall</hi> Stones have been known to cure the bitings of Serpents, and the ſtinging of Scorpions; this Effect proceeded not at all from the Stars, but from ſome ſecret Properties in the Stone, whereon the Figure of a Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion, or Serpent, was graved.</p>
                  <p>This Objection is anſwered in two words. I ſay then, that we have already proved, that the Stars have power to communicate this Vertue to the Stone; and alſo, that it is not at all Naturall to it, and proceeding from Its Own proper Vertue: becauſe that, before it was Figured, and prepared under certain Gonſtellations, it had no ſuch Vertue at all. And indeed, to what end ſhould a man take ſo much paines in graving, and preparing it under diverſe Aſpects of the Stars, if it had as much Vertue before? To what purpoſe alſo ſhould the Inhabitants of the Country of <hi>Hamptz,</hi> in <hi>Turkie,</hi> trouble themſelves to take the Impreſſion of a Scorpion that is figured upon a Stone in a certain Tower, in a piece of Potters Clay, if ſo be the Clay it ſelfe had the ſame Vertue before? We ſay therefore, that it had not Any Vertue before, Proper for ſuch an Operation; and that this Vertue was communicated unto It, by the
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:114719:132"/>Stone in the Tower; and to the Stone, by the Starres.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall not here examine the Arguments of <hi>Gul. Pariſienſis,</hi> which are to be ſeen un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Title of the 56. Page, which is; <hi>Quòd omnia iſta quae fiunt per Imagines, malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſsimè fiant:</hi> becauſe that in this Chapter he treats only of <hi>Speaking Images,</hi> or Statues; ſuch as was that Speaking Image of a Man, which is falſly ſaid to have been made by <hi>Albertus Magnus:</hi> But the Images we ſpeak of, are quite Another Thing; as is alſo their Power. So that there is nothing want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now, to the full Vindication of them from Falſhood, and all other Calumnies, ſave only to anſwer the Eighth Objection, brought both by <hi>Gerſon,</hi> and <hi>Guliel. Pariſien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> alſo.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. And it is This; which ſeemes to be the moſt powerfull of all the reſt.</p>
                  <p>If ſo be the Stars are the cauſe of theſe Operations, why then (ſay they) ſhould not their Vertue deſcend rather upon the Living Scorpion, then upon it's Image? <hi>Quomodo,</hi> ſaies the Later of theſe, <hi>non potiùs hujuſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di virtus deſcendit ſuper ipſum Scorpionem vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vum?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If we but call to mind, what hath been before delivered, we ſhall find it no hard matter to anſwer this Objection. For,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:114719:132"/>we confeſſe, that the Living Scorpion is not at all Exempted from this Celeſtiall Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; ſeeing that, if It be applied to the Wound, It cureth it, as well as It's <hi>Taliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manicall</hi> Image: ſo doth the Crocodile, the Rat, the Toad, the Dog, and the Viper al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. And if in all the reſt of Living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures we find not the ſame Effect; it is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for want of ſearching after it, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Defect in Nature: ſeeing that thoſe, that are moſt skilled in the Wonderfull Works of God, do certainly aſſure us, that where-ever any Diſeaſe is found, There alſo is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy to be had. And who would ever have thought, that the Gravell, which is found in Urine, ſhould ſerve for a Remedy againſt the Stone? and a world of other the like Secrets there are, which are daily brought to Light. But it may here be demanded; Why then ſhould not the Stars communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the Vertue of driving away Scorpions, as well to the Living Scorpion, as to it's Image?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, that if it were ſo, Nature ſhould then make warre againſt It Self, and ſhould utterly deſtroy it ſelf in a ſhort time; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that all Living Creatures would ſoone be deſtroyed by one another. Moſt wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly therefore was it ordered, that the Stars only, and Men, ſhould have this Vertue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated unto them.</p>
                  <pb n="224" facs="tcp:114719:133"/>

Mag. l. <hi>1.</hi> C. <hi>4.</hi> quaeſt. <hi>1.</hi> De In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant.</note> The Ninth Objection, is, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of <hi>Delrio,</hi> to the Reaſons brought by <hi>Cajetan,</hi> and <hi>Pomponatius.</hi> For, whereas the Later of theſe ſaies, that although <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure</hi> be not the Beginning, and Cauſe of Operation, yet it may operate very much: ſeeing that we may obſerve out of Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that the Figure of a Foule, Deform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Man, ſtrikes us with a kind of Sadneſſe; whereas a Beautifull works in us an Effect quite contrary. Beſides, Beautifull Objects do ſo move us, as that we love them; which Foul, and Ill-favoured do not at all: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith <hi>Pomponatius,</hi> Figures have ſome Power to Operate. <hi>Delrio</hi> anſwers nothing to this, but only to the Conſequence; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying that Magicall Figures are Beautifull, or Deformed. But, even Children may eaſily perceive, that his Antecedent is utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly falſe. For, thoſe Figures, which he cals <hi>Magicall,</hi> and we <hi>Taliſmanicall,</hi> are Truly, and Really, Beautifull, or Deformed, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the things are, which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent; which are, for the moſt part, the Heavens, and the Stars; the Beauty where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of raviſheth our Senſes. Beſides, theſe Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures do ordinarily repreſent ſome Conſtel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation or other; as the <hi>Virgin,</hi> the <hi>Twinnes,</hi> and the reſt. Now if a Living Virgin, and Living Twins, are Beautifull, or Deform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:114719:133"/>why then ſhould not their Figures, or Pictures be ſo too? Let us now proceed to the Arguments of <hi>Cajetan,</hi> which <hi>Delrio</hi> refutes with as little Reaſon, as he hath done thoſe of <hi>Pomponatius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Learned Cardinall then layes down this moſt True, and Powerfull Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in favour of <hi>Taliſmanicall Figures. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gura licet non ſit ipſum principium Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis; eſt tamen conprincipium.</hi> He proves the Antecedent: <hi>quia in artificum inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis efficit Figura, ut illa ſic, vel ſic operentur; tum quia ferrum latum ſuper aquas fertur, quod ſi in formam aliam contrahas, demergetur.</hi> Theſe reaſons of his are ſo Strong, and ſo Certain, as that it is Impoſſible to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw them. For, ſeeing that a Plate of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron that is Large, and very Thin, will ſwim upon the water; but if you reduce it into a Round Solid form, it ſinks preſently: is it not evident, that this proceeds meerely from the Figure? What manner of Spirit muſt he be of, that dares affirm the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; unleſſe it be one that meanes to ſay, however, as <hi>Delrio</hi> ſaies; whoſe Anſwer you have in theſe words. <hi>Reſpondeo, Figuram eſſe Conprincipium in motu locali, &amp; Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionibus quae per hunc motum fiunt; ut ſunt variae diviſiones continui per dolabram, per malleum, per aſciam, per ſerram; non verò in
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:114719:134"/>Operationibus quae fiunt per alterationem.</hi> I cannot but wonder, that this Acute Jeſuite, who hath ſhewed himſelf in other things a moſt Learned, and Sound Philoſopher, ſo that he comes not ſhort of any in the whole Society, ſhould ſo groſly offend here, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe very Philoſophicall Maximes, which himſelf hath laid down. For, where he grants, that <hi>Figure</hi> is a Co-principle in Locall Motion, and in the Operations which this Motion produceth; but not in thoſe which are cauſed by Alteration; he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes againſt that, which Himſelf had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore laid down; ſeeing that, according to the Common Conſent of all Philoſophers, Heat is cauſed by Motion: but Heat is a kind of Alteration: Therefore Figure is, of It Self, a Co-Principle in the operations which are cauſed by Alteration.</p>
                  <p>Again, when he grants to <hi>Cajetan,</hi> that a Large piece of Iron may perhaps ſwim up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the water; yet he ſaies, that it is not by reaſon of the Figure, but of the Quantity: theſe are his words. <hi>Sed eſto, fiat; erit, non ratione Figurae, ſedratione Quantitatis.</hi> Well; but of It Self, and in Sound Philoſophy, <hi>Quantitas non eſt activa:</hi> See then what the Conſequence muſt be. And in the end, when <hi>Cajetan</hi> concludes, that it is the <hi>Figure</hi> therefore that makes a large piece of Iron
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:114719:134"/>to ſwim upon the Water; <hi>Delrio</hi> anſwers, that this Figure is only Accidental: for, ſaith he, let this Large, Thin piece of Iron be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into ſome other Figure, either Circular, Square, or Five-angled, it will doe the ſame: that is to fay, it will ſtill ſwim upon the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: therefore the Figure Operates not, but by Accident. But here <hi>Delrio</hi> deceives him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; for <hi>Cajetan's</hi> Purpoſe is not to oppoſe one Flat Figure, or, as the Mathematicians ſpeake, <hi>In plano,</hi> againſt another Flat Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, either Square, or Circular: but a Plaine, Flat Figure, againſt a Solid one. For a Flat Figure, whether it be Square, Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, Octogonall, or of what faſhion ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it be, will doe that, which the ſame Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, if it be ſolid, will not doe: which is moſt True; ſeeing that a piece of Iron that is Square, and Thicke withall, ſinkes preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the bottom of the water; which the ſame piece of Iron would not doe, were it Square, and very Thinne It is therefore a moſt Undeniable Maxime, that <hi>Figure</hi> hath ſome Power to Operate.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. The Other Objections which are made, againſt the Power of theſe Images, are ſet downe, and refuted by <hi>Galeottus:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">De De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrina promiſe. c. <hi>24,</hi>
                     </note> the moſt weighty of which, are theſe following.</p>
                  <p>In theſe Images which are ingraved on Gold for the cure of the Stone, and the Pain
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:114719:135"/>in the Reines, the Gold of its One Nature cannot worke this Cure; much leſſe then can the Image; which being without Life, cannot by any meanes alter the Gold, and change it into another Nature. Beſides, in the Image there is found neither Action, nor Paſſion: againe, the Gold, of It ſelfe, whether it be fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured, or not, is ſtill of the ſame <hi>Species;</hi> and Conſequently the beames of the Starres muſt alwaies work upon it, after one and the ſame manner: and if it ſhould work rather upon Gold which is Figured, then upon that which is Plaine; this Action would ſeem to proceed, rather from the Election of the Heavens, then from any other Cauſe. In a word, the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, which is attributed to this Figure, can neither be Natural, nor Artificial: Not Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, becauſe it proceeds from Within: much leſſe is it Artificial; becauſe it is not commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated unto it by the Artificer: it muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neceſſarily proceed from ſome Other Cauſe.</p>
                  <p>The Learned Anſwer of <hi>Galeottus</hi> to theſe Objections is this. <hi>Non Enim in hac re mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatio ſpeciei requiritur, nec proprietas auri im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutatur, nec ulla Caelorum Electio intervenit, nec ab Artifice vis illa ſanandi datur, nec I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mago, ut Imago, quicquam Efficit, &amp;c. ſed principium Actionis ac Paſſionis affert, ut B.

So the diverſity of Hils, and Vallies, is the Cauſe of a greater either Heat, or Coldneſſe. We may alſo here adde an Inſtance in pieces of Ice, which the Sun cannot ſo eaſily melt, and diſſolve, if they be Plaine, and ſmooth; but very eaſily, if they be Uneven; and Rough. Which hath given occaſion to ſome to ſay, that Painted Figures are nothing ſo Proper to the Subject we treat of, as Graven, and Carved are: which is moſt True. As for Gold, although the Figure change not the <hi>Species</hi> of it; yet notwithſtanding it renders it more Apt, and Proper for ſuch an Action: as Water, Cold, and Hot, though it be ſtill the ſame <hi>Species,</hi> yet the one will boyle our Meat, when the other will not. Which makes <hi>Galeottus</hi> to conclude, in theſe termes: <hi>Requiritur ergo, in unius &amp; ejuſdem ſpeciei

<pb n="231" facs="tcp:114719:136"/>cited: where defending the honour of <hi>Virgil,</hi> who is branded with the name of a Necromancer, becauſe that he ſometimes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied himſelfe to the making of theſe <hi>Taliſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall Images;</hi> he boldly affirms, that all the ſtories, which are reported of this Poët, are Falſe, and Ridiculous. He denies then, Conſequently, thoſe Images which He made; as, the Brazen Fly, which he ſet up, upon one of the gates of the City <hi>Naples;</hi> which, for the ſpace of Eight yeares, kept all manner of Flies from comming into the City. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies alſo that other <hi>Taliſman,</hi> of a Horſeleech, graved on a Plate of Gold; which he caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Well, for to drive away the vaſt multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of Horſleeches, that annoyed the ſame City. In a word, he ſtands not to diſpute, whether the Operations of theſe Images are Natural, or not: but hee plainly denies in Termes, that there was ever any ſuch thing in the world: as if he could not by any meanes have defended <hi>Virgil's</hi> Innocence, without eaſting himſelfe upon this Extreame, and giving the Lye to all the Authors that have reported theſe ſtories. That which he ſayes, in the Progreſſe of his Diſcourſe, by way of confirmation of his Aſſertion, is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſame Rate. For, by reaſon of the great number of Places, from whence theſe beaſts are reported by Hiſtorians to have
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:114719:137"/>been driven away; one may, ſaith he, very well doubt, whether, becauſe they are ſaid to have been driven from ſo many, they were ever driven from any, or no. As if, becauſe of the great number of Battails that <hi>Hannibal</hi> is reported by Hiſtorians to have fought with the <hi>Romans,</hi> we might not, by the ſame Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, doubt, whether hee fought any with them, or no. He ſaies moreover, that <hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liger</hi> had good reaſon, to make himſelf mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with one of theſe Fly-drivers, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made a <hi>Taliſmanicall Plate</hi> for This Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Purpoſe; he had no ſooner ſet it up, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one of his Windowes, but a Fly comes preſently and ſhites upon it for Handſell. But he muſt not thinke, that theſe Reaſons of his are able to derogate any thing, from the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which we have acknowledged theſe Figures to have. For, (that we may give him his Anſwer,) if ſuch a Phyſician is not able to Cure a Sicke man; or if ſuch an Arithmetici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an be not able to bring to an end ſome Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which he hath begun: ſhall we therefore conclude, that Phyſicke, and Arithmetick, are Falſe and Ridiculous? An Able man can do that, which an Ignorant man cannot: and if he alſo ſometimes faile, it muſt be imputed to ſome default, either on his part, or on the Matter; and not in the Science, which is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible. In which notwithſtanding there are
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:114719:137"/>ſo Many Things to be obſerved, that I cannot wonder much, if many men find not the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect anſwer their Expectation. Another rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which renders the Endeavours of men herein often Fruitleſſe, is, the little Certainty that we have, of Celeſtiall Affaires, as being ſo farre removed from us. And this is that, which <hi>Roger Bacon</hi> ſaith.<note place="margin">Lib. cit.</note>

<pb n="234" facs="tcp:114719:138"/>the Power of it, in diverſe places. As con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Author, called <hi>Gervais,</hi> who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes to <hi>Virgil</hi> theſe <hi>Taliſmanicall</hi> Images; as namely, a <hi>Brazen Fly,</hi> a <hi>Golden Horſeleech,</hi> and ſome others: the high Imployments which he was taken into by the Emperour <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho,</hi> (to whom he was Chancellour:) and the booke which he preſented him with, the Title whereof was, <hi>Ocia Imperialia,</hi> ought in my Opinion, to render him a man Worthy of Credit: for as much as it highly concerned a man of his Ranke, and Condition, to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh nothing, but what was both Grave, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and True. And certainly, if he ſhould have ſo much forgotten himſelfe, as to have preſented the Emperour with a parcell of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, Impoſſible, Fabulous ſtories, as <hi>Nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daeus</hi> is pleaſed to call them; this would have been the meanes to have made him been cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed downe for a Foole; eſpecially in a Princes Court; where there are alwaies found ſome High Spirits, that cannot flatter at all; and ſome others, who, envying the Fortune of the Great Ones, will be ſure to examine their very Leaſt Actions; and will not pardon the Leaſt Fault they commit. How then would they have pardoned Thoſe Faults, which were Criminall; ſuch as are thoſe, which they would charge him with; which are not fit to have proceeded (I will not ſay, from a Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:114719:138"/>but) from the moſt Wretched Poët that lives? If it be ſaid, that Princes have oftentimes the like books preſented to them, which are full of Lies, and other Impertinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies: I anſwer, that ſuch bookes however are never preſented by a Chancellour, or by any Perſon of Note, or Conſideration in a State. Neither yet do ſuch Bookes, by whomſoever compoſed, eſcape from being anſwered by ſome or other: but, as for This of our Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour, who hath ever refuted it? nay rather, what Hiſtorian hath not tranſcribed him, and inſerted his Stories into his owne writings, as moſt True ones? And whereas ſome may ſay, that he hath ſome things, which ſeem Ridiculous, and Incredible: I anſwer, that they ought not to be ſo eſteemed; ſince that the Ages paſt, and even theſe Our Owne Daies do produce the like. So, that Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Tower, or Steeple, which <hi>Necham</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports to have been made by <hi>Virgil,</hi> with ſuch wonderfull Art, as that the Tower, which was built all of ſtone, moved to and fro, when the Bell rung out; is not without Parallel: for at <hi>Mouſtiers,</hi> a City of <hi>Provence,</hi> the Stee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whoſe ſtones are all mortaifed one within another, hath in a manner the very ſame mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that the Bell hath in Ringing; and that in ſo ſtrange a manner, as that ſometimes thoſe which are on the top of it, knowing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:114719:139"/>of it, when they perceive the Bells begin to ring, are very much affrighted: which, I confeſſe, happened once to my ſelfe.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. I could in like manner make good the greateſt part of thoſe other Stories, which are reported of this Poet; which the ſame <hi>Nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daeus</hi> accounts both Falſe, and Impoſſible; but that I ſee on the other ſide, that they come very farre ſhort of thoſe Admirable Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſome certaine Inſtruments, Images, and Figures, which Our Owne Age hath brought forth. As, for Example, thoſe Admirable Clocks, which are to be ſeen; one whereof I ſaw at <hi>Ligorne,</hi> brought thitherto be ſold by a <hi>Germane;</hi> which had ſo many Rarities in it, as I ſhould never have believed, if my owne Eyes had not ſeen it. For, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides an infinite number of Strange Motions, which appeared not at all to the Eye; you had there a company of Shepheards, whereof ſome played upon the Bag-pipe, with ſuch Harmony, and Exquiſite Motion of the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; as that one would have thought, they had been alive. Others Daunced by Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, keeping exact Time, and Meaſure; whiles others capered, and leaped up &amp; down, with ſo much Nimbleneſſe, that my Spirits were wholy raviſhed with the Sight.

And now let the Reader judge, if the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of that bold, raſh <hi>Apology,</hi> have any juſt reaſon to ſay, as he does, that this Learned Chancellour to the Emperour <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho</hi> was not in his right Wits, when he wrote the fore-mentioned Book; where the Effects of thoſe Figures, which he attributes to <hi>Virgil,</hi> have much leſſe of Wonder in them, then Theſe we have here ſpecified. So that conſequently, a man might, by this meanes, defend this Excellent Poet, againſt the Imputation of Magick, without denying (both againſt the Experience of Former A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and of Our Own,) the Power of <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſmans;</hi> the Truth, and Efficacy whereof you may ſee acknowledged, (that I may trouble my ſelf no longer to prove it,) in the works of thoſe Authors which we have formerly cited; whoſe Quality renders them both without Suſpition, and above all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach.</p>
                  <pb n="240" facs="tcp:114719:141"/>
                  <p n="14">14. After all theſe Objections, there are yet ſome Other may be made, which have quite eſcaped our Criticks: I ſhall firſt propoſe, and then anſwer them; to the end I may cleare this Subject, which hath been ſo Unjuſtly cried down, of all Doubts, and Difficulties.</p>
                  <p>It may be then Objected, that, ſeeing that, in making of a <hi>Taliſmanicall Image,</hi> we are to grave only One Celeſtiall Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure; the reſt, which ſhould concurre in the Operation, not finding their Image there, cannot Operate at all.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is Ridiculous to grave the Figure of a Ram, a Lion, and ſo of the reſt; ſeeing that the Conſtellations, whoſe names theſe are, do not doe the buſineſſe, in the Effects which we ſee in Nature; but rather the Sun, paſſing through the parts of the Heavens.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Vertue of the Other Stars will be communicated to the Image, as well as of thoſe, which we chiefly deſire to make uſe of; ſeeing that, both the One, and the Other, do continually ſend forth their Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences: thoſe therefore, that are of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Qualities, will hinder the Operation of the Other.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, theſe Figures muſt needs be Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious, and no whit Naturall; ſeeing
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:114719:141"/>that the Figure of a Scorpion, either Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, or Imboſſed, on a Stone, hath not only the power to cure the ſtinging of a Scorpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, It ſelf; but is able alſo to communicate This Power to Another Figure, taken from it, in a Piece of Clay: as in that we have ſpoken of.</p>
                  <p>To the Firſt I anſwer, that a man may, if he pleaſe, grave Diverſe Images, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Diverſity of the Signes that he would obſerve. Such a one was that <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſmanicall</hi> Stone of the <hi>Sr. de Bagarris,</hi> which was ſeen in <hi>Paris,</hi> by diverſe Learned Men: ſuch a one alſo is one of thoſe Silver <hi>Taliſmans,</hi> that <hi>M. de Mareſcot,</hi> Maſter of the Requeſts, ſo much honoured me, as to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate unto me; although I conceive it to have been made by ſome Superſtitious perſon. For, beſides the Table of Latine Cifers that you find there, and ſome Chymical Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters; there are alſo three Angelicall Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters, like unto thoſe that are found figured in a Book intituled, <hi>Les Clavicules de Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon:</hi> which makes me ſuſpect all the reſt. The Figure of a Woman, which you ſee on the One Side, is certainly meant for the Sign of <hi>Virgo:</hi> and the three Hebrew Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which are on the other ſide, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, are the Abbreviatures of theſe three Entire words, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>El haſcem Echad:</hi> that is to
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:114719:142"/>ſay, word for word: <hi>God; This Name is one.</hi> Mr. <hi>de Peyreſc,</hi> of whom I have formerly made mention, a man that is moſt Exact and Skilfull in Matters of Antiquity, hath, among the many Rarities which his Cloſer affords, very many of theſe <hi>Taliſmanicall</hi> Figures alſo; which he could not have the opportunity of conveighing to me, becauſe that the Intercourſe with <hi>Lions</hi> hath been broken off, by reaſon of the Sickneſſe. I may poſſibly hereafter have the Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to communicate them to the World. But to return to the buſineſſe in hand. The Influences of many ſeverall Stars may be communicated to one Sole Figure; as the Vertue of many ſundry Hearbs, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from the ſame Stars, may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into one Medicine. This Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon is uſed by <hi>Marſilius Ficinus,</hi> who, following the opinion of the Ancients, ſaies: <hi>Illa verò ex quamplurimis conflari pro arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trio poſſunt. Ut ſi centum Sclis, Joviſque de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, per centum plantas, &amp; animalia, ſimilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que ſparſae fuerint; componere ſimul haec cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum tibi comperta poſsis: &amp; in unam conficere formam, in qua Solem fermè, Jovemque to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum jam videaris habere.</hi> So that there is no great Neceſſity that the Figures of all the Conſtellations ſhould be ingraved, but only of That, which you would have to
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:114719:142"/>Operate the moſt Effectually. And though the Other Starres meet not with a Figure ſemblable to their Operations; yet will they Operate notwithſtanding: for as much as they doe continually ſhed forth their Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences upon all things indifferently; and do communicate their Vertue to the Gold, or to the Stone; though ſome, more; and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome, leſſe; according to the diverſe Aſpects, under which they were wrought.</p>
                  <p>To the Second Objection I anſwer, in one word, that it is all one, whether it be the Twelve Conſtellations of the Zodiack, or the Sun in them, that ſheds forth theſe Influences, ſo that we be but aſſured by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that they come from ſuch a part of the Heavens, and that the Effect alwaies followes: we are therefore alwaies to grave ſuch a Figure, as is Correſpondent to this Effect, whether it proceed from the Sun, or from the other Stars. And yet it is Manifeſt, that it proceeds not Principally from the Sun; ſeeing that the reſt of the forty eight Conſtellations, which are not in the Zodiack, and through which the Sunne paſſes not at all, do nevertheleſle, in ſome ſort, Operate alſo.</p>
                  <p>The Third Objection is as caſily Anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as the Former: foraſmuch as thoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellations, which are of a Contrary Nature
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:114719:143"/>to the Effect which we deſire, though they do Operate; yet it is but Faintly, and with Little Force: for we uſe to obſerve the time, either when they are not in our Hemiſphere; or if they be, we then take them, when their Aſpect is weakeſt, and when a Fortunate Star accompanies them.</p>
                  <p>The Laſt Objection is indeed the moſt Difficult of all the reſt; ſeeing that the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, which we find Imprinted in a <hi>Taliſman,</hi> ſeemes to ſurpaſſe the Power of Nature. Nevertheleſſe we are able to make it appear, that there is nothing Extraordinary in it, by inſtancing in the Loadſtone; which having communicated it's Vertue to a Peice of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, This Peice of Iron communicates it afterwards to Another, in drawing it to it ſelf, and retaining it. In like manner may a <hi>Taliſmanicall</hi> Figure communicate it's Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to Another Figure, which ſhall have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Impreſſion from It; which ſhall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards have the power to work the ſame Effects: only the Difference is, we can give a Reaſon of this Later, though not of the Former. For, the <hi>Taliſman</hi> is, as a Brick, made very hot, which is able to heat ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Brick, though not with ſo much force, as the Fire does: and the ſame is to be ſaid of the Print of a <hi>Taliſman</hi> in Clay, which can never be ſo Powerfull in Operation, as
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:114719:143"/>the <hi>Taliſman</hi> it ſelfe; which is heated, or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrated, by the Beams of the Stars.</p>
                  <p>We conclude then, that we may Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, and without the Aid of Spirits, prove, by the Secrets of Nature, not only the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of theſe Images, but of many other O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations alſo, which are more wonderfull. As, for Example, to ſend Newes to our friends, in leſſe then an houres ſpace, above an Hundred Leagues off: as <hi>Trithemius Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas;</hi>

To doe ſuch Miraculous things, by the help of Looking-glaſſes, as we would think to be utterly Impoſſible: ſuch as were thoſe ſtrange Operations, which <hi>Roger Bacon</hi> undertooke to do in the number <hi>Nine;</hi> by which hee promiſed the Pope, that if he would furniſh him with ſuch a Summe of mony, as the Charge of making them would require, he ſhould be able to annoy the <hi>Turkes</hi> more by theſe Glaſſes, then by an Army of a Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Thouſand Men. Briefly, if <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> had not informed us, that the Image in the Aire which inſeparably followed a certaine man, ſo that he could never be rid of it, was Naturall: would it not preſently have been concluded, that it was ſome Familiar Spirit, or ſome <hi>Demon,</hi> that took upon it the Figure of this Man? And yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:114719:144"/>this was only the Effect of the Man's own Weakneſſe of Sight; which being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to penetrate the <hi>Medium</hi> of the Aire, it's beames were reverberated, in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as in a Looking-glaſſe; ſo that, when e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his Eyes were open, he ſtill ſaw his own Image in the Aire.<note place="margin">De ſenſ. ter.

                  <p>All things are ſweet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, ſo that the Truth be but knowne: and certainely my Enemies muſt of Neceſſity leave perſecuting me, unleſſe they are more ſenſeleſſe then Beaſts. I publiſh then Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and Boldly, This Curious piece of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which the Ignorance of the Hebrew tongue kept a long time hid from the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. But ſeeing that my Cuſtome alwayes is, firſt of all to cleare the Subject which I han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, from all ſuſpicion; it concernes me, that, before I diſcover the Secrets of this Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of the Ancients, I make it appeare, that Men have, without juſt Reaſon, or Ground, queſtioned the Purity of this Science; which, teaching how to erect Nativities, under the diverſe Aſpects of the Stars, makes us Able to Foretell, and that by a way of Natures owne teaching, the Good, or Evill Fortune that ſhall befall men.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Thoſe then that oppugne the Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Aſtrology, make uſe ordinarily of theſe two Reaſons: firſt, that it is Vaine, and of no Truth; and ſecondly, that it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the Maximes of our Religion; which requireth nothing at our hands, but
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:114719:146"/>this <hi>Burden of the Cloiſter; Obedience,</hi> and <hi>Humility.</hi> And if we but conſult the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, where this Decree is to be ſeen, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in red letters; you will finde, ſay they, that it is not without Cauſe, that This Art is cried down; ſeeing it impoſeth a <hi>Neceſsity</hi> upon our Actions: and that the Principle on which it is grounded, hath been of ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Conſequence, as that it hath planted Idolatry in the Mindes of Men. Now if theſe Arguments had not been already anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by ſo many Authors, it would concerne me to examine them in this place: but <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall de Aliaco, Lucius Bellantius, Melanch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thon, Pirovanus, Goclenius,</hi> and <hi>Ranzovius,</hi> have ſo judiciouſly done it, to the ſatifaction of the moſt Criticall Palate, as that he muſt be no Man, that ſhall not acknowledge their Reaſons to be moſt Juſt, and Sound. For, if the Church, ſay They, cannot endure the very name of <hi>Aſtrology;</hi> it is not meant of that Kind of <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> which, by the Riſing and Setting of the Stars, and by their ſeverall Conjunctions, is able to foretell Rain, Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Stormes, and Tempeſtuous weather, and, by Conſequence, the Plenty, or Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of Fruits: as alſo, by the Nature of theſe Celeſtiall Figures, to judge of the Naturall Diſpoſition of a new born Child: as, that it will be of a Temperate Humour, if it be
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:114719:146"/>borne under a Temperate Signe; and for the ſame reaſon, will be alſo Meek, Affable, and Courteous: or elſe on the contrary, if it be borne under a Malignant Conſtellation, by reaſon of Its being either too Cold, or too Hot, and Parching; the Child will alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound with the Like Humour, and ſo a man may proceed on in his judgement of him, and pronounce of him Probably, and without captivating the Will at all, that he will be Quarrelſom, and Ill-natured; and theſe Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels being alwayes accompanied with ſome ill Accident, or other, one may conclude, that he will be Vnhappy, and Vnfortunate: and many the like things may be foretold, which I ſhall here omit; becauſe they are ſo common, that even Children know them. This then is not the <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> againſt which the Church hath given Sentence; but that O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sort, which hath been Juſtly condemned; which attributing more Power to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, then it ought to do, impoſeth a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie upon the Freeſt Part of our Soule.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Authors have likewiſe given the ſame Anſwere to the Firſt Argument, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Incertainty of this Art, which we have before brought to prove the Truth of the Power of Figures. We may therefore account all thoſe to be very Obſtinate, and Self-conceited men, who, to aſperſe <hi>Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,</hi>
                     <pb n="252" facs="tcp:114719:147"/>do reckon up all thoſe <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> of note, that have been found Liers: whereas they ſhould alſo as well have produced the names of all thoſe that have hit right, and whoſe Predictions have even aſtoniſhed all thoſe, that have ſeene the Event to follow. So, the great <hi>Picus Mirandula,</hi> who, for writing againſt <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> more, and more reproachfully, then ever man did, was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Flagellum Aſtrologorum,</hi> met at laſt with one <hi>Lucius Bellantius</hi> of <hi>Syena,</hi> who was not at all deceived in his judgement that he gave upon his Nativity: for he foretold him, that he ſhould die in the Thirty fourth year of his Age; which accordingly came to paſſe. And did not <hi>Junctin,</hi> an <hi>Italian,</hi> of the City of <hi>Florence,</hi> foretell, that Himſelfe ſhould die of ſome Violent Death, and upon the very ſame day was knocked on the head, by his Books in his own Study falling upon him? But that we may not weary our ſelves, in turning over bookes, in ſearching for Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of this Kind, even our owne Country of <hi>France</hi> will be able to affoard us enough, and he muſt have been a blind man, that hath not obſerved them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Certainly the Conſideration of theſe Truths prevailed ſo much upon the Minds of the moſt Learned men, that lived in the days of our Fathers, that without any making Doubt,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:114719:147"/>or Scruple at all, they put Pen to Paper; imploying their moſt precious hours of Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, in Confirmation of what their Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſours had herein delivered: addicting themſelves ſo much the more freely to this kind of Study, for that they ſaw it was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted alſo, even by the moſt pious Doctors of the Church. <hi>Damaſcene,</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Damaſc. <hi>2.</hi> lib. de Fide.

                  <p n="3">3. I ſhall here paſſe by all that the reſt
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:114719:148"/>of the Fathers have written,<note place="margin">Acrote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leut. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtronom.</note> touching this Particular; all which is diligently collected, by <hi>Rodolphus Goclcnius,</hi> a Phyſician of <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg:</hi> neither doe I purpoſe to make an Apology for this Science; for, I ſhall reſt ſatisfied in the Churches Determination: Only I will here ſet downe, what the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of the Rabbins is, in this point in hand.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, that I may cleare theſe Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets from all manner of Suſpition, it will concern me, in few words to ſhew, that there can be nothing more Falſe, then what is uſually given our, to the Diſparagement of this our Aſtrology; namely, <hi>That the Beginning of It, hath given Riſe to Idolatry. Gulielmus Pariſienſis,</hi> in his Firſt Part <hi>de U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſo,</hi> denying the Power of the Stars in Figures, which we have before treated of, endeavoureth to confirme This Opinion; which was firſt broached by ſome Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in the Primitive Church. <hi>Theophraſtus Paracelſus</hi> hath alſo ſince judged it True, in his Book <hi>De Morb. Inviſib.</hi> in the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which treats of the Diſeaſe, which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the name of <hi>S. Valentine,</hi> or, the Falling-ſickneſſe; where he ſaith: <hi>Quidam ex populo obſervarunt, quòd &amp; Planetarum Conjunctiones &amp; Oppoſitiones, &amp; alij curſus Coeleſtes, tales morbos irritarent, &amp; augerent;
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:114719:148"/>unde etiam ſectae natae ſunt, ut quidam credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derint, Stellas eſſe Deos.</hi> But this Opinion hath no Solidity in it at all; and that for Three Reaſons. The Firſt is, becauſe the Patriarks, according to the Teſtimony of the moſt Authentique Authors, were the Inventors of this Science. The Second is, becauſe that their Children practiſed it, and were Blameleſſc. And the Third is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a very hard Matter, Truly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, whence Idolatry tooke it's begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
                  <p>As for the Firſt, <hi>Joſephus</hi> affirmes,<note place="margin">Antiq. <hi>1.</hi>
                     </note> that <hi>Adam and Seth,</hi> were the Firſt that practiſed this Science; whether it were in them, Infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, or Acquired: and that <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he fled into <hi>Egppt,</hi> taught it the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> This Truth hath ſo much the more Force in it, in that it proceeds from a man whoſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is Unqueſtionable. So that we may perceave, that <hi>Plinie</hi> is much miſtaken,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 5, 6, 7.</note> when he affirmes, that none but <hi>Atlas</hi> was the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it: for, beſides that we are very cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that <hi>Aſtrology</hi> was in Vſe, long before <hi>Atlas;</hi> he contradicts what himſelfe had ſaid in the Book immediately going before; where he would have <hi>Belus</hi> to have been the Firſt that invented <hi>Aſtrology:</hi> although afterwards again he aſſures us, the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> were the men. But ſuppoſe we ſhould grant him, that
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:114719:149"/>the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> or elſe, as others will have it, the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> were the Inventers of it: yet ſtill will it be true, that the <hi>Patriarks</hi> were the Men; foraſmuch as, <hi>Abraham</hi> was an <hi>Aſſyrian;</hi> and his Predeceſſours were <hi>Phoeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians;</hi> a <hi>Colony</hi> of <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> having gone into <hi>Phoenicia,</hi> as we have elſewhere proved. I ſhall not here ſpeak of the Two pillars which are reported to have been erected before the Floud; upon one of which, all the Rules of <hi>Aſtrology</hi> were ingraved, by <hi>Seth;</hi> and which was preſerved downe to the very time that <hi>Joſephus</hi> lived in, who affirmes himſelfe to have been an Eye-witneſſe of it. Now it could never enter into any mans breaſt to imagine, that theſe Firſt <hi>Patriarks,</hi> obſerving the Motions of the Heavens, did worſhip the Stars: it were a great Crime to entertain any ſuch Thought. Idolatry therefore took not its Beginning from <hi>Aſtrology.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. The ſecond Reaſon is grounded upon All Story, both Sacred, and Profane: where any one may ſee, that there are very few Ages paſſed, wherein there was not ſome Great Perſonage that was Famous for his Knowledge in <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> without being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for it by any. It is true indeed, that the Primitive Chriſtians condemned <hi>Aquila;</hi> who is no other, then the Famous Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Bible, knowne by the name of <hi>On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kelos:</hi>

And peradventure the Princes of the Eaſt, eſpecially thoſe of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> for the more firme Imprinting of this Error into the minds of their Subjects, added the Name of ſome Deity, to their Owne; as, for Example, that of <hi>Baal,</hi> to <hi>Hanni:</hi> which being joyned together, make <hi>Hanni-bal,</hi> by leaving out one Letter, for the more ſmooth Pronunciation; and ſo in <hi>Haſdru-bal,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others.

<pb n="266" facs="tcp:114719:153"/>thinke, that it was not till after, while the Wonderfull Works of God were yet freſh in the Memories of Men.

However we doe not yet ſee any thing to the Contrary, but that <hi>Aſtrology</hi> is Innocent, and cleare from the Crime, that it is charged with. We will now by the way ſet downe, (that we may leave no doubt behind us,) that which no Author, either of the Greeks, or Latines, hath yet diſcovered; and which Reaſon muſt needs allow, as moſt true.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. <hi>Bechai</hi> then ſaith, that the Ancient <hi>Chaldeans</hi> are very falſly accuſed, to have been ſuch wicked men, as people would make them; and to have worſhipped the Starres. For, ſaith he, if the Firſt <hi>Nazarenes</hi> (he meanes the Chriſtians) were ſo good men, as they have been reported to have been,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:114719:153"/>in the firſt Ages of their Belief: why may we not aſwell believe the ſame of the Firſt Men, who were created with a thouſand times more Simplicity, then ever hath been found in any of their Poſterity ſince? And who can believe, that they ſhould ſo give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves over to thoſe Vile Abominations, wherewith they now ſtand charged? This Argument is not much different, from that of <hi>Alexander Halenſis.</hi> Nevertheleſſe <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine</hi> is quite of another Opinion, and ſcoffes at thoſe Authors, who will have the Firſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to have beene ſuch Golden, and Silver ones. But, if he had weighed the buſineſſe rightly, he would have found; that thoſe Vices, which the Ancients are accuſed of, are ſo ſmall, in compariſon of thoſe, that the Corruption of the Times hath ſince brought forth; that they deſerved rather to have paſſed for Merry Pranks only, and to have been ranked among Veniall ſins. But to return to <hi>Bechai.</hi> That which he obſerves of theſe Firſt Men; and, which, I ſay, hath been obſerved by no man elſe, is; that thoſe Fires which they made, in honour of the Sun, and Moon, were Lawfull, and Kindled to a good End. For, ſaith He, they teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſame thing to God, which God teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to them by the Sun, and by the Moon, which is nothing elſe but a <hi>Great Light.</hi>
                     <pb n="268" facs="tcp:114719:154"/>They kindled theſe Fires then, by way of returning Him thanks, for His; and, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up to the Stars, they prayed to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, which God had there placed, for to move them about, to the End they might be Favourable unto them. But, as the beſt things come at length to be corrupted; <hi>Cham,</hi> or his Poſterity, looking no higher, then to this Fire, began to worſhip it; and ſo, ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating their Adoration in the Sun, and Moon, they paid them thoſe Honours, which the Firſt Chaldeans meant to None, but to the Author of theſe Stars alone.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. This Opinion of the Learned Jew may be proved, by two, or three Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. The Firſt is, that the Wiſe men of the Former Ages had knowledge of the Inviſible God, by the Things that are Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. Now of the things that are Viſible, there is none that more powerfully proves, that there is a God, then the wonderfull Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the Sun, and Moon, and the reſt of the Stars. They had knowledge of God therefore, by the Stars. And whereas the Apoſtle ſaith, that though they knew him, yet they glorified him not afterwards; he ſpeaks of thoſe Philoſophers, which had knowledge of him only by this Naturall way: But the Firſt <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> beſides this way of Knowledge, had knowledge of
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:114719:154"/>him alſo by Revelation. It is Probable then, that this Later way, joyned with the Former, brought them to a juſt acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Him; which they expreſſed by theſe Fires, which they kindled in Honour of Him. Another Concluſion is, that theſe <hi>Chaldeans</hi> had not as yet dealt with Spirits: and although that, after the Floud, a great part of this People, whom the Pride of <hi>Cham</hi> had corrupted, had addicted themſelves unto them; yet notwithſtanding the greateſt part ſtill kept themſelves to the Lawes of their Fathers; and would not acknowledge any other <hi>Demons,</hi> ſave thoſe Spirits, which they conceived to have their Reſidence in the Stars. But I ſhould perhaps be thought to talk Idly, with this Rabbin, had I no other Proofes of this, but what I have out of his Schoole. But theſe Truths are acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged alſo by <hi>Jamblicus,</hi> who is of the ſame Perſwaſion. <hi>Chaldaeos verò,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Ficinus,</hi> ſpeaking of this Philoſopher,) <hi>Daemonibus non occupates, Aegyptijs antepoint.</hi> See alſo what <hi>Porphyrie</hi> ſaies, ſpeaking of the Oracle of <hi>Apollo,</hi> which was enforced to ſay, that</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall not here meddle with any of theſe Queſtions; namely, Whether this hollow Blew Ball intimates, that the Ancients con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Earth to be of this Figure: whence peradventure ſome of the Greeke Writers tooke occaſion to ſay, that it was of the forme of an <hi>Omega.</hi> 2.

<pb n="277" facs="tcp:114719:158"/>et motus omnium ipſorum ſit unus, et omnes ſphaerae ipſarum revolvantur ſuper eoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem Polos.</hi> 3. Whether the three Great Circles repreſent the Three Heavens, which the moſt Learned do acknowledge Only; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting the Aire, or the Vaſt <hi>Extent,</hi> which is betwixt the Earth and the Heavens, for the Firſt; the Heaven, wherein the Stars are, for the Second; and the Place of the Bleſſed, for the Third: avoyding by this meanes that Diſpute, concerning the Heaven that S. <hi>Paul</hi> was caught up into. Neither will I Poſitively determine, whether, or no, this Green Line, or Circle, be the ſame with That, which is called by the Cabbaliſts, <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea viridis quae circuit Univerſum.</hi> I ſhall paſſe by all theſe Queſtions, which ſome other may reſolve; that I may come to thoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures which I promiſed; which wil let us ſee, how little Aſſurance we an have, of the Antiquity of this Inſtrument.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Firſt is, that ſeeing that before the time of theſe Rabbins, no man ever made mention of this Inſtrument; and that, before theſe men gave us the Deſcription of it, the Doctrine, on which it was built, was known; it is Probable, that it was invented after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, upon this Doctrine. The Second is, that <hi>Rabbi Kapol,</hi> who was a very Learned Aſtrologer, makes not any mention at all of
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:114719:159"/>it, in any of his Aſtrologicall writings; as neither hath <hi>Abraham Avenar;</hi> nor, before Them Both, <hi>R. Moſes.</hi> It is true indeed, that <hi>Aben Eſra</hi> in his <hi>Sphere of the Hebrewes, Indians, Perſians, Egyptians, and Arabians,</hi> an Author often cited by <hi>Scaliger,</hi> cals to mind a certaine Inſtrument, that was arci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently much in uſe among theſe People: but ſeeing he gives us no Deſcription of it at all, and ſpeakes but ſparingly of it; we may conclude, that it is Vncertaine, what the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick of it was; for otherwiſe, he would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly have deſcribed it, as being Neceſſary, in the matter he had in hand.</p>
                  <p>The Laſt Conjecture, which makes me thinke, that this Inſtrument was never in uſe, among the Ancient Hebrewes, is, becauſe that the Names of the Moneths, which are graved on the Circle of the Moon, are not Hebrew, but Chaldee: and although ſeven of theſe names are to be found in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Bible, which are theſe; <gap reason="foreign">

We may conclude then, from theſe three Conjectures, that this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument is none of thoſe, which were in uſe among the Ancient Hebrewes: and we may adde, to this Concluſion, that as well the Figure, as the Invention of it, is unknown to us.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Figure of <hi>Ahaz</hi> his Diall is more certaine; or rather, is leſſe ſuſpected of Novelty: but that the Fabricke of it, as it is delivered to us, is entirely perfect, and ſuch as it was Anciently, I finde not many Reaſons to induce me to beleeve. For as much as, except only one Rabbine, who is indeed a very Learned man, I have not met with any Hiſtorian, either Chriſtian, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, Aegyptian, or Arabick, that hath taken any notice of it, or ſo much as touched upon
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:114719:160"/>it. Yet becauſe there is leſſe uncertainty found in it, then in the Sphere aforeſaid; and alſo, in caſe any man ſhould have a minde to take one ſingle Authors word in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; I am content to give you the Deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, as he hath delivered it, ſeeing it is Proper to my Subject in hand. For the Ancients, in their <hi>Horoſcopes,</hi> did often make uſe of theſe Dials, whatſoever the Faſhion of them was, obſerving exactly the juſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the two Greater Luminaries. We doe not finde then, throughout the whole Bible, any mention made, of theſe Sciotericall, or Sunne Dials, ſave only in the <hi>Laſt Booke of the Kings;</hi> the Author whereof, ſpeaking of the Cure of that Good King, who was Sonne, and Father to two other ſo Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable ones, ſaith: <hi>Invocavit itaque Iſaias Propheta Dominum, et reduxit umbram per lineas, quibus jam deſcenderat in Horologii Achas, retrorſùm decem gradibus.</hi> The Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall Hebrew calls this Inſtrument <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>Maghalot Achaz;</hi> that is to ſay; <hi>the Aſcenſions, or Degrees of Achaz.</hi> So much for the Name: but as for the Figure of it, there is no man hitherto, that hath publiſhed, what it was: I ſhall therefore be the Firſt, (after <hi>R. Eliahou Chomer,</hi>) that ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate it to the world: and it was after this manner. A Stone, or elſe a Plate of
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:114719:160"/>Copper, of what Bigneſſe a man pleaſed, was wrought into the Forme of a Creſcent; the hollow part whereof encompaſſed a Ball, or Globe, of the ſame ſubſtance, having the houres of the Day deſcribed upon it. This Globe, or Ball, was compaſſed with a Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, which was raiſed above it about two In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and had 28. holes bored in it; which ſerved to ſhew the Houres, as well by the Moon, as by the Sunne; in this manner. The Inſtrument was placed upon a Pede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtall, or elſe upon a Window only; (as <hi>Chomer</hi> ſaith, That of this Kings was:) but in ſuch a manner, as that one of the Hornes of the Creſcent, which was to be fitted to the Elevation of the Place, muſt reſpect the Eaſt; and conſequently, the Circle, that croſſed it, would look toward the South. When the Sunne then ſhone, it caſt a ſhadow towards the Oppoſite Horne; ſo that, the ſhadow falling upon the Round Ball, the height whereof exceeded not that of the two Hornes of the Creſcent, it ſhewed exactly the houres, till about Ten of the Clocke, (according to our manner of reckoning the houres:) at which time the Sunne, being too high, could not caſt the ſhadow any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger upon the ſide of the Horne: ſo that, for the following Houres, this Defect was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed by the Circle; which ſhewed the
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:114719:161"/>houres, till about Two in the Afternoon. After which time, as the Sunne declined, the other Horne of the Creſcent began to ſhew the houres, till Night. And thus, of the Twelve houres of the Day, the Circle al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſehwed foure of them; that is to ſay, from Ten, to Two in the Afternoon: and this Part of the Day is ſtill called, by the Eaſterne men, <hi>Mid-day,</hi> or <hi>Noone;</hi> dividing the Day naturally into three parts; <hi>Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Noone,</hi> and <hi>Evening;</hi> as having long ſince loſt the uſe of Dials; as <hi>Scaliger</hi> hath obſerved. As for the houres of the Night, they were found out upon this Inſtrument, by the Moon; by caſting its ſhadow upon a little Pinne of wood, wherewith one of the Holes of the Circle, round about which the Howres were deſcribed, was to be ſtopped every day: So that this Pinne which appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on the top of it, ſerved inſtead of a Stile, or Cock of the Diall; which the Greeks call <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. If I had not found ſome Difficulty in this Obſcure Deſcription, I would have here ſet down the figure of it, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how this Diall is to be made. But I had rather be ſilent, in things that I doe not fully underſtand, then to ſpeake by gheſſe: ſome better leaſure may perhaps giveme Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, to diſcover This Secret, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate it to the world. At preent I ſhall
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:114719:161"/>only adde, that <hi>Jonathan's</hi> Paraphraſe calls this Inſtrument, whether it be a True one, or not; <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="6">6. And here <hi>Aben-Eſra</hi> obſerveth, that thoſe Sun-Dials, which wee uſe to ſet up in Gardens, for Ornament ſake, have ſome kind of Reſemblance, with this here deſcribed: and he makes a Doubt; whether, or not, the Fabricke of them hath not been borrowed from, or made in Imitation of this Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

The Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy of the Hebrewes had not as yet loſt any of its Luſtre, ſo long as it was practiſed by thoſe of That Nation Only: but ſo ſoon as the

I hold it therefore Neceſſary, before I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to that which we have of Puritie, and Truth, in this Science, to give a Touch firſt at That which is Falſe, and Corrupted.

The Firſt, Second, and third, of theſe above-named, doe unjuſtly attribute to the Jewes ſuch a kind of Aſtrology, as they never were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with: the Fourth will needs have them to have acknowledged, in the Secrets of this Science, Certain Spirits; which never had any Being, ſave only in his own Fancy: and makes them to have been the Authors of a world of Fopperies, which have been forged by the Greeks, and Latines, upon this Subject: And the Laſt of them makes ſuch a Strange, Wild thing, of the whole Doctrine of it; and ſets it forth in ſo Groſſe, and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous

For, as concerning
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:114719:164"/>the names of the Angels, which, according to the Opinion of the Ancient Aſtrologers, have their Reſidence in the Seven Planets; he is right but in one of them: all the reſt being either Corrupted, or elſe Invented by Himſelf; as will appear to Any Man, that ſhall but compare them with the True Ones, ſet down by <hi>Aben-Arè,</hi> who is tranſlated into Latine by the <hi>Conciliator.</hi> As for thoſe Seven <hi>Intelligences,</hi> which <hi>Duret</hi> hath aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Seven Planets; he had need be a very Subtile Theologiſt, that can ſhew any Reaſon, why he makes a Diſtinction betwixt the Seven Spirits, which he calls by the names of <hi>SEMELIEL, NOGAEL, COCHABIEL, LEVANAEL, SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BATHIEL, ZEDEKIEL, MADI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MIEL;</hi> and their Intelligences, <hi>NA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CHIEL, HAGIEL, TIRIEL, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIMEL, AGIEL, JOPHIEL, GRAPHIEL.</hi> But may we not very well laugh at <hi>Carlo Fabri,</hi> an Italian; who hath fince tranſlated theſe Fopperies into his own native Language; (and hath beſides given other ſtrange Names to theſe Angels, the moſt of which he hath taken out of <hi>Raziel, Picatrix, Agrippa,</hi> and a Book entituled, <hi>Les Clavicules de Salomon;</hi>) of all which, <hi>Duret</hi> will need have us believe the Hebrews to have been the Authors; as likewiſe of the Twelve

The Planet <hi>Mars,</hi> being in the firſt. Degree of <hi>Aries,</hi> they repreſented a Man, holding a Sickle in his Right hand; and in is Left, a Bow: In the ſecond De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, a Man, having the head of a Dog, and holding a Cudgel in one hand, and having the other ſtretched forth: In the Third, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Man, lifting up one hand to Heaven, and in the other, ſeeming to point at all, that is in the whole Univerſe: In the Fourth, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Man again, with curled Hair, having a
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:114719:168"/>Hawke upon his Right Hand, and in his Left a Flaile. In the Fifth, two Men; one eleving wood with a Hatchet; and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, bearing a Scepter in his hand. The reſt of the Degrees have their ſeverall Figurs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; which I ſhall paſſe by, that I may come to the ſecond Signe, which is <hi>Taurus:</hi> into the Firſt Degree whereof when <hi>Mercury</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, they pictured a Man, holding a Cud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel in his hand, with which he drives an Oxe to the Shambles. In the Second Degree, a Woman, holding in her hand a Horſes taile. In the Third, an Old Woman, covered with a Vaile; or elſe a Woman in Breeches. In the Fourth, another Woman, holding a Whip. And that I may trouble my ſelfe no further in reckoning up all theſe Figures, the Reader may ſee them, if he pleaſe, in the foreſaid Booke; where <hi>Scaliger</hi> ſaies, that he hath taken them out of the Writings of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> and that theſe kinds of Pictures were in uſe among the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> But, (with all Reſpect to ſo great a Scholler be it ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken) I muſt take leave to ſay, that he was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo farre wide of the Truth, as Here: and if any be ſo Curious, as to deſire to be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in this Particular, he may be pleaſed to take notice, that <hi>Scaliger</hi> hath tranſcribed them word for word, out of a Second Book of a Worke entituled <hi>Aſtrolabium Planum,</hi>

The Truth of this may be proved, by the fore-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Booke of <hi>Aponenſis,</hi> whoſe very words he hath alſo made uſe of: but contenting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with the bare Names of theſe Figures, he would not trouble himſelfe with the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of them.

I ſhould not have here made this Obſervation, but only that I might be the better able hereafter, to make knowne the Vertue of the Aſtrology of the Ancient <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes;</hi> which was, in a manner, the ſame with that of the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> and the more Learned among the <hi>Arabians:</hi> out of whoſe Bookes, <hi>Scaliger</hi> vainely ſaies, that he hath beſtowed much paines in collecting the ſaid Figures. For there hath long ſince been ſuch a World of Strange things, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had Being, foiſted upon this Science; that people generally now adaies ſticke not to ſay, to the great Diſadvantage of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> that
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:114719:169"/>there is no Truth, or Certainty in theſe kind of Studies.

This Learned Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loger having obſerved, that thoſe that are borne under certaine Conjunctions of the Planets with the Signes of the Zodiack, were alwayes inclined to one and the ſame thing: as, for example, the Planet of <hi>Mars</hi> being the Aſcendent in the Firſt Degree of <hi>Aries,</hi> thoſe that are then borne, are commonly Labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and lovers of War; he figured a Man, as we have ſaid, holding in one hand a Sickle, which ſignifies Labour; and in the other a Bow, the Hieroglyphicke of War. In like manner, thoſe, that are borne, when the ſame Planet is in the Second Degree of the ſame Signe, are Quarreſome, and Envious, as Dogs: and this made him repreſent a Man with a Dog's head, holding a Cudgell in his hand. The Figure of the third Degree, ſhews that the Child will be a lover of Peace. The Fourth, that hee will hardly be Rich, ſcattering about what hee ſhall have gotten, which is ſignified by the Flail, and the Hawk. When <hi>Mercury</hi> is found in the Firſt Degree of <hi>Taurus,</hi> the Child will be addicted to
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:114719:170"/>Blood, and Butchery: and therefore he ſigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a Man with a Cudgel, driving an Oxe to the Slaughter-houſe. If in the Second De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, he will be given to Idleneſſe; as the Woman, that holds a Horſ-taile in her hand. If in the Third, a Woman will deſire to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in her Old Age, and endeavour to be thought young; according to the Figure of the Old Woman, that is covered with a Vaile, or elſe wearing a Paire of Breeches. If in the Fourth, the Child will be Quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome; which is ſignified by a Woman, figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with a Whip in her hand. And ſo of all the reſt, as you may ſee in the Author him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. We may conclude then, that theſe Aſtrologicall Deviſes are no more of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes,</hi> and <hi>Egyptians</hi> inventing, then the <hi>Brazen Horſe</hi> is of mine.</p>

                  <p>Firſt then, the Ancient <hi>Hebrewes</hi> repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Stars of Heaven, either All Together, or ſeverally, by the Letters of the Alphabet; in the ſame manner expreſſing, and diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing them, as we do, by the names of <hi>Aries, Taurus,</hi> &amp;c.

<pb n="304" facs="tcp:114719:172"/>time,) were ended; they then went onto expreſſe the reſt of the Stars by Two Letters together; by this means, making up a Word: to which alſo they added a Third Letter; the more perfectly to expreſſe the nature of the Star, or Conſtellation. And perhaps a man may be able, by this Doctrine, to put an end to that Long Diſpute, that hath been raiſed, concerning the Signification of thoſe names of Stars, which we meet with in the Bible: as, for Example, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="2">2. And by this we may ſee, that the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Hebrewes</hi> fancied not the Figures of any Living Creatures in the Heavens, as we do.

                  <p n="6">6. Theſe Ancient Fathers then, having found out the Planet that ruled at the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of a Child; they preſently began to foretell, in Generall Tearmes, according to the Quality of the Signe, what manner of Perſon it was like to be. I ſay, in Generall Tearmes: not ſtanding to reckon up ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Particulars, as Aſtrologers now a daies doe: who will undertake to aſſure us, that if a Child be borne in an houre, for Example, that <hi>Saturne</hi> governes, it will be an Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant, Sloathfull, Dreaming, Melancholicke, Subtle, Wary, Impudent, Sad perſon; and ſhall love Black things, be very Meager, and Leane, ſhall have much, and black Haire, ſhall be Pale, Envious, Hollow-eyed, given to ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, ſhall keep his Anger long, will be ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, and ſelfe-conceited, and ſhall not much care for the company of Women; he will ſoon grow gray, and ſhall not be very rich; he will be a hater of all Company, and will be given to talke to himſelfe; and, above all, will be a faithfull keeper of Secrets. The Ancient Hebrewes, I ſay, took no notice of all theſe Particulars; neither did they admit of any Diſtinction of Signes Humane, and Brutiſh; Double, or Single; Right, or Crooked; Terreſtriall, or Aquaticke; Fruitfull, or Barren; Strong, or Weake; Lying, or Standing; Seeing, or Hearing;
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:114719:178"/>Loving, or Hating; that is to ſay, that they are the Authors of Seeing, Hearing, Loving, Hating, and the like; All which Effects are ſpecified by <hi>Manilius.</hi> But they ſaid only, that the Child would be Health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, or Sickly; without particularizing any Diſeaſe; that it would be Fortunate, or Vnfortunate; without ſpecifying wherein. And, in briefe, they foretold, in Generall Termes, the Good, or Ill, that ſhould befall it; according to the Benevolent, or Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Nature of the Signes. For they ſaw, that <hi>Saturne,</hi> by reaſon of its being ſo Cold; and <hi>Mars,</hi> by reaſon of its great Drineſſe, were very Malignant: <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> being Temperate, were very Favourable Stars; as alſo was the <hi>Sunne:</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> of an Indifferent Nature. But as for the <hi>Moon,</hi> they thought ſo diverſly of It, as that when it was at the Full, they accounted it Fortunate; but when it was Horned, they thought it to be ſo Malignant, as that, if a Child were borne under ſome certaine of its Aſpects, it died not long after; or, if it li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, it would prove to be guilty of Crimes, as great, as its Temper was Blacke. And this is that, which moved the Wiſe Women among the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> to write, or cauſe to be written upon the Walls of their Bed-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, at the time of their Falling in Travell,

Now if it be demanded; why doe we not then any where elſe meet with the like Example? <hi>Jacob Ben-Samuel</hi> anſwereth: that This was obſerved, chiefly, by reaſon of the Jealouſie, that was betwixt the two Siſters, <hi>Leah</hi> and <hi>Rachel, Jacob's</hi> Wives. For, <hi>Leah</hi> ſeeing, that her Siſter had two Children already; which made her ſo proud, as that She began to boaſt, <hi>Comparavit me Deus cum ſorore mea:</hi> fearing, leſt that after She ſhould have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven over Child-bearing, her Siſter would have the upper hand of her, and that She ſhould be no longer beloved by her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; She gave her Maid unto him, and
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:114719:184"/>cauſed him to goe in unto Her: and as ſoon as ſhe perceived her to be with Child, ſhe obſerved ſo well the time of her falling it Travell; that ſeeing her bring forth a Mar Child, and that under the Planet <hi>Jupiter</hi> too as ſhe had learnt to ſpeak, from her Husband ſhe accounting her ſelfe now more happy then her Siſter, would have him called alſo by the name of this ſo Propitious a Planet.</p>
                  <p>And theſe were the Aſtrologicall Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations of theſe Patriarks; which were ſo much the more Holy, and Religious, in that they wrought in theſe Good Men, a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall Admiration of the Works of God. But, thoſe that came after them, mixing ſuperſtition with this Aſtrology of their Fore-fathers; it came in a ſhort time to be Corrupted, and to looſe its Firſt Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. Thus the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> who were neighbours to the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> of whom they alſo learnt this Science; were the firſt that filled it with a world of Vanities, or rather, Abominations: as you may ſee in <hi>Rabbt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> his <hi>Ductor dubiorum;</hi> who often cites theſe Books: <hi>De Servitio Egyptiaco: De ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu Zabiorum: &amp;, De Arte Magica,</hi> which is otherwiſe a very choiſe Book; a part where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I have ſeen in <hi>Hebrew;</hi> but it was Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally

And certainly, if they had deſired to have repreſented <hi>Saturne,</hi> by a Sickle; they would have figured a Sickle; and not have ſet downe this Character ♄, which is no whit at all like it: and ſo of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter,</hi> ♃; of <hi>Venus,</hi> ♀; and the reſt. And now let any one judge, what reaſon we have to give any Credit, to the Author of thoſe Collections, which are inſerted at the end of <hi>Hyginus</hi> his Works; when he tels us, that theſe Characters came, not only from the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> but from the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> alſo. <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daicae ſunt,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>atque Egyptiacae Notae, quibus Planetae ab Aſtronomis inſigniuntur.</hi> But he, good Man, underſtood not, that the Reaſons, why <hi>Saturne</hi> is pictured with a Sith, or Sickle; and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> with a Thunderbolt, were things theſe People never dreamt of; and were a long time after forged, by the

Thus in the twelve Houſes, wherein the Planets mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Aſpects to each other, throughout the Signes of the Zodiacke, are ſet downe; they thought ſit to foretell of the Child, not ſuch things as take their Originall from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant of the Childs Birth, which are called <hi>Congenitae;</hi> and which the Ancient <hi>Hebrewes</hi> alſo obſerved; but, from thoſe rather, that happened after its Birth. Thoſe that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to be ſatisfied herein, may have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to <hi>Scaligers.</hi> Notes upon <hi>Manilius;</hi> where he ſets downe the manner of erecting this kind of <hi>Theme,</hi> or Figure of a Nativity: where the Firſt Houſe ſhews, that the Child ſhall be a Houſe-keeper: the Second, that he ſhal be a Souldier, and a Travailer; the Third, that he ſhall be a man of great Employment; and ſo of the reſt.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Houſes, <hi>Manilius</hi> calleth, <hi>Athla;</hi> as, for example, when he would ſay, the <hi>Firſt Houſe,</hi> he ſaies, the Firſt <hi>Athlon;</hi> or the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. <hi>Athlon,</hi> &amp;c.

                     <pb n="332" facs="tcp:114719:186"/>were only the <hi>Theme</hi> of a <hi>Nativity,</hi> or <hi>Horo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcope,</hi> as they are now uſually taken: whereas He affirmes, on the Contrary, that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor underſtands hereby, whatſoever is Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, beſide the Natural Inclination of the Child. <hi>Et ut meliùs,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>mentem Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nilij aperiam, duo Themata homines praecipua inſtituit; alterum Geniturae, alterum Actionum.</hi> So that theſe <hi>Athla</hi> are not the <hi>Theme,</hi> or Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of the Nativity, or of ſuch things, as are borne with us; but rather, whatſoever wee Acquire afterwards. And here <hi>Scaliger</hi> takes occaſion to let the world know, that Himſelfe is the onely Man, that hath reſcued his <hi>Ath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> out of the very Jaws of <hi>Oblivion;</hi> which, he ſaies, is a word uſed only by <hi>Manilius;</hi> and which, though it be very Ancient, yet neither the <hi>Jewes, Greeks,</hi> nor <hi>Arabians</hi> had any knowledge of. He confeſſeth them, that it is very Ancient: Now would I very faine aske this Queſtion of Him: Whether this Word, if it be ſo Ancient, be either <hi>Greeke, Hebrew,</hi> or <hi>Arabicke?</hi> I ſuppoſe, hee would be very wary, how he anſwered this Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, leſt he ſhould be forced to contradict himſelfe.

Now all theſe Figures, or Signes, may be repreſented in the Clouds: and the Reading of them may be performed, three manner of wayes. Either by Letters, or Knowne Characters; or by Hieroglyphickes; or laſtly, by Signes, or Markes, which doe repreſent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, and not Obſcurely, that which we read. For, theſe Signes are different from
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:114719:189"/>Hieroglyphickes, in this; that Hierogly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phickes doe repreſent things Obſcurely; as, for Example, expreſſing a Battail by a Sword: but the other contrary wiſe, Clearly, and Plainly; as namely, one Battail, by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. Now all theſe Letters, Markes, and Hieroglyphicks, are repreſented not only in the Clouds, but ſometimes alſo in all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Meteors; as Comets, Lightning, Raine, Haile, Snow, Manna, and White Froſts; as we ſhall ſee hereafter. We begin with the Clouds.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The moſt Intelligible Signes, Marks, or Characters, that are figured in the Clouds, are Armed Men, Onſets, Armes, and Battels; which appearing in order, for many daies together, do give notice to Men, of ſome ſemblable Event to follow. Now whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe Prodigies proceed from ſome Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Cauſe, or elſe are produced by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Almighty God, for to admoniſh us of our ſins; we ſhall examine hereafter: but this is moſt certaine, that we never faile of ſeeing the Event to anſwer the Sign; and that to the great Aſtoniſhment of all thoſe men, who would reduce all things, to the Principles of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy. About twenty foure yeares before the Birth of our <hi>Saviour Chriſt,</hi> there were two Armies ſeen to encounter each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in the Aire; and that with ſo great vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:114719:189"/>as that men might heare (if at leaſt the ſtory be true,) the Running of their Horſes,<note place="margin">Vid. T.

Not long after, was the truth of this Viſion made manifeſt to the world. For <hi>Marius</hi> and <hi>Sylla,</hi> by their Factions, making, as it were, a Shambles of the Feilds; were the cauſe of ſo much Bloodſhed, as that the Romans never received a greater Blow, then This. In like manner, when the <hi>Gothes, Hunnes,</hi> and <hi>Lombards,</hi> invaded <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:</hi> the <hi>Europeans, Paleſtine;</hi> and the <hi>Turks, Conſtantinople;</hi> there were ſeen in the Aire, Armes all bloody; Men, raging like Mad; and Dogs, ſo feirce, and cruell; as that the very Deſcription is full of Horror. But, that we may not borrow Examples abroad; it is reported, that in the yeare 1561. the like Prodigies were ſeen in our owne Country of <hi>France,</hi> and even in the City of <hi>Paris</hi> alſo; which, not long after, ſuffered under an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite number of Calamities. Of late yeares alſo, while the King continued his Seige be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Montauban,</hi> there appeared, at <hi>Caen,</hi> at the beginning of the Night, very many Dreadfull Sights in the Aire. A City ſeemed to be beſeiged, Ordnance planted, Souldiers drawne forth, and the Clouds moving for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and backward, appeared like to two pitched Battels, that ſtood ready to charge
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:114719:190"/>each other: and that which cauſed the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Terrour in the Beholders, was, that theſe Figures ſeemed to be all bloody, and, as it were, Inflamed; and the Face of the whole Heavens alſo was moſt dreadfull to behold.</p>
                  <p>Now theſe Hieroglyphicks, and Letters that are ſeene in the Clouds, are more Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent then others, though not ſo certaine. And, becauſe people doe not much take care to obſerve them, I doubt not, but if I ſhould here ſet down, what I my ſelfe have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſeen in the Clouds, I ſhould be laughed at; notwithſtanding, the Conſideration of Theſe Things ought not to be rejected, by thoſe that are Curious; as we ſhall ſhew here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.

                  <p>Thoſe men that are of opinion, that theſe ſtrange Sights in the Clouds are not Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall, and have no Signification in them, endeavour to prove their Aſſertion by theſe three Reaſons. The Firſt is, becauſe their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration is wholy above the Power of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; ſeeing that no man can aſſigne any Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Cauſe for it. The Second is, becauſe that their Duration is much different, from that which Philoſophy alloweth them. For; if we conſider the Figure of a Cloud, we ſhall finde, that it cannot preſerve it ſelfe, in the ſame Form, and bigneſs, the ſpace of one hour only; but is preſently ſcattered, and changed into ſome other ſhape, very much different from the former. But as for theſe Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Figures which we ſpeake of, they have been ſometimes ſeen to laſt, for the ſpace of forty dayes; as the Author of the Hiſtory of the <hi>Maccabees</hi> teſtifieth; who reporteth
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:114719:191"/>this wonderfull ſtrange Story,<note place="margin">

                     </note> here follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Eodem tempore Antiochus ſecundam profectionem paravit in Aegyptum. Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git autem per univerſam Jeroſolymam civita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, videri diebus quadraginta, per ae<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ra, Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes diſcurrentes auratas ſtolas habentes, &amp; haſtis, quaſi cohortes, armatos, et curſus equo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum per ordines digeſtos, et congreſſiones fieri cominùs, et ſcutorum motus, et Galeatorum mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudinem gladijs diſtrictis, et telorum jactus, et aureorum armorum ſplendorem, omniſque generis loricarum.</hi> A like Prodigy happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the ſame City, a little before the utter Deſtruction of it by <hi>Titus,</hi> ſon to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Veſpaſian;</hi> who was the Inſtrument of puniſhing the Inhabitants thereof, for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the moſt Horrid Crime, that ever the Sunne beheld. For, there were ſeen at that time, for above a whole daies ſpace; Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of men, running up and downe in the Clouds:<note place="margin">Joſeph. de Bel. Jud. l. <hi>7.</hi> c. <hi>12.</hi>
                     </note> and Chariots likewiſe; the very ſight whereof aſtoniſhed the Beholders. The Third Reaſon, to prove that theſe Figures are not Accidentall, nor produced by the Power of Nature only, is; becauſe that the Praiers of Godly men have oftentimes been the cauſe, that there have appeared in the Clouds, the Figures of Angels, and of Saints, whoſe Aſſiſtance hath been implored, in ſome Calamitous Times: as <hi>S. Celeſtine</hi>
                     <pb n="343" facs="tcp:114719:191"/>was ſeen at <hi>Aquileia;</hi> and <hi>S. Petronia,</hi> at <hi>Bologne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. But thoſe, who are of a Contrary O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, bring Arguments againſt the former; and maintaine; that there is nothing ſeen in the Clouds, but what may be Naturall. For, as concerning the manner how theſe ſtrange Sights are generated, it is every whit as much knowne to us, as that of Comets; which are often ingendred in various, and ſeverall ſhapes; as, Pointed, Round, Long, Large, and in the Figure of Haire; accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the Matter is Diſpoſed. In like manner may the Body of a Cloud be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Wind, which carrieth it to and fro, into ten thouſand ſeverall ſhapes, which appear ſtrange to our ſight; though, in themſelves, they are cleane otherwiſe. And thus the Firſt of the afore-ſaid Reaſons is overthrowne.</p>
                  <p>The Second ſeemes to have much more Force; but in Truth, hath none at all. For, though the Hiſtory of the <hi>Maccabees</hi> ſay, that theſe Fearful Sights of Armies appeared in the Clouds, for forty daies together; yet it doth not ſay, that they were Really ſuch; but only, that they Appeared to the Behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, to be ſuch. Now their Sight might be deceived, by a ſtrong Imagination, cauſed from having ſeen it once; as it often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens,
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:114719:192"/>in the like caſe. If it be Objected, that though one Single man might have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; yet, that Many could not poſſibly: and that therefore, the ſame thing having been ſeen by All, it muſt neceſſarily be Reall, and not Imaginary. To this I anſwer, that Many may be deceived, as well as One ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle perſon; ſeeing that the Imagination of Many is altogether as ſtrong, as that of a ſingle perſon; and beſides, that if the Cloud, wherein theſe Figures appeare, be Thick, and Moiſt; the Raies of our Eyes, being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed by our Imagination, may eaſily think they ſee, that which we fancy to our ſelves. This Anſwer is ſet downe more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by <hi>Pomponatius;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">De In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant.</note> who, treating of ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, and bold a Subject as this; might have cleared himſelfe of the Objections made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, by uſing another Reaſon, (which we ſhall produce hereafter,) which is both eaſie, and better knowne; without caſting himſelf upon the Maximes of a Philoſopher, that ſcarce any body underſtands. As for the Long Continuance of theſe Prodigious Sights in the Aire, it may be anſwered in a word, that it was Naturall: ſeeing that the Hiſtories doe intimate, they were not ſeene continually, and without Intermiſſion: and by Conſequence, it might ſo fall out, that at ſome time or other the next day, the Winds
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:114719:192"/>might poſſibly diſpoſe the Clouds after the ſame manner, as on the day before.</p>
                  <p>The Third Reaſon, which is, that the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures of Angels have been often ſeen in the Clouds, is not of ſufficient Force to prove, that theſe Effects are Supernaturall. For, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes the Clouds, if they be Thicke, and Smooth, doe receive the Raies, and <hi>Species</hi> of things here below; which is the Cauſe that we ſee them by Reflection, as in a Loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king-glaſſe. By reaſon whereof, <hi>Cardan</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, that one day there was the Appearance of an Angel, ſeen in the Clouds, at <hi>Millane;</hi> which cauſed great Aſtoniſhment in the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, till ſuch time as <hi>Pelicanus,</hi> a Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, made it plainly appeare to them, that this Angel was nothing elſe but the Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of an Image of Stone, that was on the top of the Church of S. <hi>Godart,</hi> which was repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in the Thicke Clouds, as in a Loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king-glaſſe. And thus might <hi>Pomponatius</hi> have given a reaſon of the Apparitions in the Aire afore-mentioned, namely of <hi>S. Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine,</hi> at the City of <hi>Aquileia,</hi> and of <hi>S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronia,</hi> at <hi>Bologne;</hi> without engaging him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in ſo long, and tedious a Diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. From this Emiſſion of the Raies, and <hi>Species,</hi> ſome have conceived, that all thoſe Figures that are ſeen in the Aire, are nothing
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:114719:193"/>elſe, but the Images of things here below. And therefore they ſay, that thoſe Armies, which have been often ſeen in the Aire, were the Raies of ſome Armies, that were in ſome part of the Earth, or other. And ſo, that Navy of Ships, that was ſeene floating in the Clouds by the <hi>Romans,</hi> when they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring to goe againſt the <hi>Genois;</hi> and againſt <hi>Perſes,</hi> the laſt King of the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> who was vanquiſhed by <hi>Aemilius,</hi> was likewiſe nothing elſe, but the Image of their owne Navy, which appeared upon the ſmooth ſurface of a Cloud. And according to this Doctrine, peradventure, the Armies of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Kings may be knowne; and Newes may be conveyed, at a vaſt diſtance; there being nothing to hinder it. For, as for thoſe Objections which are made againſt the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi> that <hi>Cornelius Agrippa</hi> ſpeaks of, which he ſaid might be done, by the help of the Moon, which ſhould receive the <hi>Species</hi> of the Characters, as a Looking-glaſſe doth; they can have no place here; for as much as the Clouds are not very farre removed from us; and the Raies of Characters, or any other things, preſented before them, cannot be ſpent, before they can reach ſo farre, as they muſt needs do with the Moon, by reaſon of its too great Diſtance. And thus perhaps is that Secret of <hi>Trithemius</hi> diſcouered; where
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:114719:193"/>he undertakes to ſend Newes abroad, and make it knowne a great diſtance off in an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, by the help of certaine Spirits, whoſe names he there ſets downe; which are, in my Opinion, nothing elſe but the Winds; ſome whereof are more proper for the diſpoſing of of the Clouds, then others are. We may poſſibly diſcourſe ſome other time, more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of theſe Secrets of his; which have beene hitherto accounted, either utterly Falſe, or elſe Diabolicall.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. It remaines now, that we ſatisfie this Doubt here propoſed: Namely, whether theſe Figures that are ſeen in the Aire, and in the Clouds, be the Images, and Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of things here below, and conſequently purely Naturall, and are of no ſignification: Or, whether they are produced, and formed, by the Providence of God, who ceaſeth not continually to forewarn us, by ſome Viſible Signe, or other, of what Evils ſoever are to befall us; as we have formerly ſaid.<note place="margin">Chap. <hi>3.</hi>
                     </note> To which I ſhall give this Anſwer, which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to be moſt True: Namely, that, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all doubt, Many of theſe Figures are Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall; and are produced, either Accidental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in the Clouds, or elſe by the Emiſſion of the Image, and <hi>Species</hi> of things here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, as we have already ſaid: But that there are alſo ſome, which we muſt referre to the
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:114719:194"/>wonderfull workes of God. Of this Later kind are Thoſe, ſpoken of by the Author of the Hiſtory of the <hi>Maccabees;</hi>

                  <p>If it be here objected, that theſe five Horſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men might poſſibly have been the Image, and <hi>Species</hi> of ſome of the Armie; I anſwer, that it appeares by the Circumſtances, that this could not be ſo; it being moſt evidently true, that theſe Horſemen did not only ſeeme to fight; but did Really fight, and charge the Enemie. And if the Lightning here menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, had been Naturall, and had beene diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged from the Clouds; Both Armies ſhould then have felt it alike. But ſeeing, in that confuſion, and mixture of both Armies together, the Darts fell from Heaven upon One of them only, and not upon the other;
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:114719:194"/>we muſt neceſſarily conclude, that this was the Hand of God: Beſides, that this Prodigy happened alſo, in a cleare, bright day, when the Aire was darkned with no Cloud. So that, as I am of Opinion, with <hi>Cardan,</hi> and <hi>Pomponatius,</hi> that oftentimes we may ſee in a Cloud, as in a Looking-glaſſe, the <hi>Species</hi> of the Statue of an Angel, or of a Saint, placed either on the top of a Church, or elſewhere; or elſe, that our Sight may be deceived, and betrayed by our Imagination: ſo do I like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe believe, that theſe Viſions may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alſo be Divine; as was that Image of a Croſſe, ſhining moſt gloriouſly in the Aire, which was ſeene by <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great; who afterwards found the Event to follow, according to the words, that he ſaw written on it: <hi>In hoc ſigno vinces.</hi>

                     <hi>Cardan</hi> cannot believe, that there is any Extraordinary Matter in This Raine: for as much as, the Red Drops (ſaith He) lighting upon Mens Cloaths, might appeare in the forme of a Croſſe, by reaſon of the Waters ſpreading it ſelfe all along the threads, which are wrought Croſſe-wiſe. But here he takes no notice, that the Hiſtorians, that report this Story, affirm; that theſe drops of Blood fell in the forme of Croſſes, not on Cloaths only, but upon the Stones alſo, and upon
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:114719:195"/>their Meale: which is an Evident Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, that the Cauſe of it was not Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, but proceeded from ſome Divine Power. And certainly, the ſame kind of Rain, figured like Croſſes, which happened in the time of <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate, what could it betoken, but the Sufferings of the Church, and the Ignominy of the Croſſe? If you but run over the Annals, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider theſe ſeverall yeares, 747.783.959.1503.1507. you ſhall find, that the like Prodigies have been the Fore-runners of ſuch Truths, as have moſt certainly afterwards come to paſſe. I ſhall not here ſpeake of the Raining of Wheat, Wine, Oyle, Hony, Mice, and Frogs; becauſe that their Cauſes are more Naturall. Neither will I deny, but that Theſe Things are ſometimes alſo true Hieroglyphicks: as it hath been ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time obſerved in <hi>Germany;</hi> where the People being, by an Intollerable Dearth, brought almoſt to Deſpaire; they were ſuddenly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted by a Showre of Wheat, which was ſeen to fall from the Clouds, preſaging the great Plenty of Corne that ſhould follow: which, accordingly came to paſſe.</p>

Thus the <hi>Manna,</hi> wherewith the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were fed in the Wilderneſſe, beſides the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Wonders, that it was indued withall, had This alſo added to the reſt, (as ſome of the Rabbins report,) that the graines of it were figured with the Hebrew Character <gap reason="foreign">

For, there hath Haile been often ſeen, which hath borne the Figure, either of a Croſſe, a Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, a Heart, or of a Death's-head: and if we doe not careleſly paſſe by theſe Wonders, when we meet with them; we may, no doubt, afterwards find the truth of the Events, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told by theſe <hi>Hieroglyphicall</hi> Figures. It is not many years ſince, that, in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> a Friend of mine, being abroad on hunting, was upon the ſudden amazed, at an Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Noyſe of Thunder, and of a moſt Violent Wind: which made him bethinke himſelf, how to get to ſome Shelter. But, as he was got a good way into the Wood, which led to his Dwelling; thinking with himſelf, that he ſhould not be able to reach his own Houſe, before the Rain fell, which commonly followes ſuch kind of Tempeſts, he took up his harbour under a Rock: un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which he had not ſtaied about the ſpace of a Quarter of an houre, but that, thinking the Malice of the Storm had been ſpent, by a light Showre of Raine that had fallen; he began to go on with his Journey. But he was not gone a Stones caſt, but he ſaw ſome Haile begin to fall; which made him think of going back again. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:114719:198"/>upon better Conſideration, he began to think, that this Haile could not be very trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome to him, ſeeing it fell in ſo ſmall a Quantity; and preſuming withall, that the Thickneſſe of the Trees would be well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough able to ſecure him from the violence of it. This Conſideration had certainly put him upon his Journey again; had he not by Chance, caſting his eye upon ſome of the Haileſtones, as they fell, obſerved, that they appeared to be of another kind of ſhape, then commonly they uſed to be. This made him ſtay, to take better notice of them; ſo that taking one of the Haileſtones up in his hand, he inſtantly perceived a Fearfull Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digy in it. For, ſome of them bare the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of a Head-piece; others, of a Scutche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and others, of a Sword. This Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Novelty amazed him, and the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of ſome Diſaſter at hand, made him return back to the Rock again: where he was no ſooner arrived, but that there fell ſo great, and ſo violent a Storm of Haile, as that it killed not only Birds, but very many Beaſts alſo. The like to this, I my ſelf have alſo ſometime obſerved, in <hi>Provence.</hi> This man then, returning home, after the Storme was paſt, could find no more ſuch figures upon the Hailſtones, as he had ſeen at firſt: which made him conclude, that this Prodigy would
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:114719:198"/>not end with the Death of theſe Beaſts: as he had indeed moſt Truly Conjectured. For, within a little while after, this Miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Country had its Fields covered with Souldiers, and its Revolted places beſieged, and aſſaulted, with ſo much Blood-ſhed, that the very Memory of it will be alwaies very grievous unto us.

Then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth the Peſtilence, and all other Diſeaſes, by reaſon (ſaith <hi>Kepler</hi>) of the Corruption of the Aire; and Earth-quakes alſo, which are cauſed, not by Winds that are generated by the Vapours iſſuing from the Comer, and getting into Cavernes, and Subterraneous places; as <hi>Kepler</hi> maintaines: but, by the Vapours that are Naturally ingendred with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the bowels of the Earth, by the great Heat cauſed in it; which, ſearching for ſome paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to get forth at, and finding none, by an extreame Violence cauſeth this Motion; which is for the moſt part accompanied with
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:114719:201"/>ſome Diſeaſes, or other; cauſed by the Noyſome Vapours, that aſcend out of Theſe Cavernes. Beſides, the Aire being Heated, together with the Malignity of the Matter of the Comet after it is extinguiſhed, or elſe, when it beginneth firſt to aſcend, over-heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our blood, is a Means of driving Princes, and Great perſonages, into ſtrange Furies; whence preſently follow Wars, Battels, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies, and a world of other ſad Accidents. Thus, a little before the Wars of <hi>Peloponeſus,</hi> there appeared a Terrible Comet, for the ſpace of Seventy five daies together.

                     <pb n="363" facs="tcp:114719:201"/>and another, the Civill Warres of <hi>Caeſar</hi> &amp; <hi>Pompey;</hi> of which <hi>Lucan</hi> writes thus.</p>

                  <p>Now all theſe Effects may proceed meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from ſome ſuch Cauſes as Theſe: But if it be ſo, that Comets burne not, nor are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by any Elemntary Exhalations here below; but, that they are Above, in the very Heavens; which is the Opinion of the Learnedeſt Mathematicians; we muſt then ſearch for ſome other Cauſes: ſo that thoſe men then, who affirme, that theſe New Fires, are Miracles; are not wholy to be neglected: for as much as it is recorded, that in the time of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> there was ſeen One of theſe Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets, wherein appeared the Figure of a Child. Whereupon the Divines, being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded what they thought of it, returned anſwer; That, This Child ſhould be Grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and more Powerfull, then <hi>Auguſtus</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; and ſuch a one, as ſhould deſerve to be Worſhipped by Him. But, now whether
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:114719:202"/>theſe Comets be the Handiwork of God; or whether they be but meere Exhalations; or laſtly, ſuppoſe them to be New Stars, appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in the Heavens; we ſhall in the next place proceed to ſhew, that their Figures are My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall Characters; or, as it were, a kind of <hi>Hieroglyphicks,</hi> by which we may be able to read, by vertue of Analogy, what Good, or Evill accidents ſhall befall us. The General Rules whereof do here follow.</p>
                  <p n="2">12. The Firſt is, that if they are figured like a Columne, or Piller; they denote the Conſtancy of ſome Prince, or of ſome Great Saint, or elſe of ſome People, or Nation. And hence, ſome of the <hi>Jewes</hi> have taken oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to affirme, that the <hi>Pillar of Fire</hi> which went along with the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Wilderneſſe, was given unto them, as a Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roglyphicke of <hi>Conſtancy,</hi> and <hi>Stedfaſtneſſe:</hi> and that it was no Ordinary Comet; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>Andreas Roſa</hi> affirms to the Contrary:<note place="margin">De nov. ſid. l. <hi>1.</hi> pag. <hi>783.</hi>
                     </note> who maintaines, that it was meerly Naturall, and had nothing Divine in it: it being the Ordinary Courſe of Nature, (ſaith He) once in two Thouſand years to produce ſome ſuch Light, as This. Thus, two thouſand yeares, or thereabout, after the Creation of the world, This Pillar of Fire appeared: Two Thouſand yeares after, which was the Second Age, was That Wonderfull Star ſeen, that appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:114719:202"/>to the <hi>Wiſe men,</hi> at the Birth of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour <hi>Chriſt:</hi> and Two Thouſand yeares af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, which is the Third Age, and which We Now live in, a New Starre appeared in the Conſtellation of <hi>Caſsiopeia.

                     </note> ſeem to favour this Opinion: But it hath nothing of Truth in it. For, beſides that this <hi>Pillar of Fire</hi> had no Proper Motion at all, as other Compets have; no more then had the Starre, which appeared to the <hi>Wiſe men;</hi> which had nothing of the Nature of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Starres in it, but only the Figure, and Light: neither yet did it appeare in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Age, (as <hi>Roſa</hi> affirmes,) but in the Third; for, they reckoned then Five Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeares from the Creation:) theſe New Starres, and Comets have been known to appeare much oftner: and conſequently it is moſt Falſe, that they are ſeene but every. Two Thouſand yeares.<note place="margin">De nov. aſtr. &amp; Comet. l. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>51.</hi>
                     </note> Thus, the Learned <hi>Lice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> hath obſerved, that within the ſpace of 30. years, or thereabouts; namely, betwixt the yeares 1572. &amp; 1604. Three new Stars were ſeene: One, in <hi>Caſſiopeia;</hi> another, in the Conſtellation, called <hi>Serpentarius;</hi> and a Third, in the Necke of the <hi>Swan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Second Rule is, that when a Comet, or fiery Meteor, is Round, Cleare, Bright, and not Duskie at all, but lookes as it were,
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:114719:203"/>like another Sun; it may ſignifie the Birth of ſome Great Prince: as <hi>Juſtin,</hi> the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian writes, that the yeare that <hi>Mithridates</hi> was borne, during the ſpace of ſeventy daies, there appeared a Comet; (ſome ſay, that it was a Star,) but ſo Wonderfull a one, as that the Greatneſſe of it tooke up the fourth part of the Heavens; and the Light of It, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſed That of the Sun. <hi>Nam</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>et quo genitus eſt anno, et ex eo quo regnare primum caepit, ſtella</hi> Cometes, <hi>per utrumque tempus, ſeptuaginta diebus ita luxit, ut coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum omne conflagrari videretur: nam et mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitudine ſui, quartam caeli partem occupave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat, et fulgore ſui, nitorem ſolis vicerat: et quum oriretur, occumberet<expan>

                           <ex>que</ex>
                        </expan>, quatuor ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium horarum conſumebat.</hi> We have already ſet downe, what Preſages may be made, from the Colour of theſe Comets.</p>
                  <p>The Third is, that if they be of a Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midall Figure, we ſhall then ſuffer great Loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes by Fire; and, by way of Analogy, may conclude, of ſome Tyranny approaching. And this is the Opinion of <hi>Cornelius Gemma,</hi> who expreſſeth himſelfe in theſe words.<note place="margin">De Nat. Divin. Charact. l. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>6.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſſis, quae in acutam Pyramidem deſinunt, Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis praedominia magis, et ex Analogia, in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publica Tyrannidem praeſignificant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Fourth is, that if they be of much Extent, Waved, and Diſſipated here and
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:114719:203"/>there, in the forme of Waters; they then denote Seditions in the People: ſeeing that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all the Hieroglyphical Characters, that ſignifie the People, This of <hi>Water</hi> is the Chiefeſt; according to that Viſion of the Prophet: <hi>Aquae multae, populi multi.</hi> And it hath been very often obſerved, that after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Inundations, either of the Sea, or of Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; the People have preſently alſo made Inſurrections.</p>
                  <p>The Fifth is, that if they be of the figure of a <hi>Horne,</hi> which is the <hi>Hieroglyphicke of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;</hi> as may be obſerved out of the Scriptures, in very many places: they foreſhew the Great ſtrength of ſome Monarch, and an Abſolute Power. Hiſtorians report, that when <hi>Xer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xes</hi> invaded <hi>Greece,</hi> with a Million of Men; there appeared one of this kind of Comets, ſhining moſt reſplendently.</p>
                  <p>The Sixt is, that if they beare the figure of a <hi>Sword,</hi> they preſage Deſolations, which ſhall be cauſed by the Sword. Such a one was that, that appeared over the City of <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> for the ſpace of a whole yeare toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and did fore-ſhew the death of Eleven Hundred Thouſand <hi>Jewes,</hi> as <hi>Joſephus</hi> te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth;<note place="margin">De bel. Iud.</note> the greateſt part of which number fell by the ſword. And in the yeare 1527. a Comet of the like Figure appeared, for many daies together; with this ſtrange Spectacle
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:114719:204"/>attending it, that it was encompaſſed round about with Launces, Pikes, and Halberts, with ſuch a great number of Heads cut off, as that the Diſcription of it was full of Horrour. Thoſe that are the leaſt verſed in Hiſtory, cannot but know, how Calamitous a Time this was. If the Comet be figured like a Trumpet; it then alſo foretells of Wars: but if it be of the forme either of a Dart, or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; or elſe of a Javelin, it denounceth both Warre, and Peſtilence; the Effects whereof flye abroad, as ſwift as an Arrow. Such a one, as this, appeared <hi>An.</hi> 80.</p>
                  <p>Now, although that in all Comets, theſe ſeverall Figures may be produced Naturally; (if ſo be, that the Matter (which we ſuppoſe to be Elementary) be aptly diſpoſed,) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be Long, Large, Pointed, Square, Ovall, Triangular, or Round; from whence proceed, Beames of Fire, Bucklers, <hi>Caprae Saltantes,</hi> which are ſo called, not, for having the figure of a <hi>Goate;</hi> but, either becauſe this Comet hath ſomething of the Reſemblance of a <hi>Goat's Beard,</hi> as <hi>Philoponus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

But if the wind chance to blow againſt them, they then preſently change their whole Order: For, whereas before, the Fore-part of their Body was divided into two Rankes, they now divide the Hinder part into two Rankes, repreſenting the Figure of a V, one of them only, flying in the head of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and dividing the Aire before them; and all the reſt, flying ſmoothy after it, as if they were joyned together in a Line, make way for the Wind in ſuch ſort, as that mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with no Reſiſtance, they flye with all poſſible eaſe, and pleaſure.

                  <p>Now the Letters, which all theſe ſeverall Birds make in their Flying, ſhew us only the Diverſity of the winds; or elſe, the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their ordering themſelves in Battell; and no more. But their Fighting, Singing, and manner of Feeding, and going to Reſt, are of more Signification then ſo: for theſe are often Signes of things to come. Thus we uſually ſee, a Sick perſon is near his End, when a Raven is obſerved to come croak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and to light upon, or fly neer the Chamber where he lies: the like whereof is obſerved alſo of Scritch-Owles, and Horn-Owles; Birds, which by reaſon of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting in Darkneſs only, and Shady pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, are accounted Unfortunate, and Omi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous. The Fighting, and Gathering toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all other ſorts of Birds, eſpecially
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:114719:207"/>Birds of Prey, and which feed upon Fleſh, doth likewiſe often foreſhew ſome ſad Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident approaching. Thus <hi>Dion</hi> reports, that when the Armies of the <hi>Triumvirate</hi> marched forth againſt the Complices of <hi>Pompey,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lib. <hi>50.</hi>
                     </note> to take a juſt Revenge of <hi>Coeſar's</hi> bloud, there were ſeen, hovering over the Troops of <hi>Brutus,</hi> and <hi>Caſsius</hi> only, great numbers of Ravens, and Vultures; which by their Many, and Fearfull Cries, did fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhew the Ruine of Theſe Two Murtherers. Neither need we travell ſo far, for Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of this Nature: for, we have a like Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to this, delivered by <hi>Aeneas Sylvius;</hi> who, comming to be Pope, was afterwards called by the name of,<note place="margin">In Europ.</note> 
                     <hi>Pius II.</hi> and it is this. In that Part of <hi>Gallia,</hi> (ſaith he,) which is furnamed <hi>Belgica,</hi> not far from the City of <hi>Leige,</hi> a Falcon, as ſhe was ſitting upon her Eggs in her Neſt, a company of Ravens, perceiving her, ſet upon her; and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with beating her, devoured her Egges alſo; and that, with ſuch Strange, and Unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall Out-cries, as that the Boors, and Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds thereabout, who had obſerved this Strange Piece of Tyranny, acted upon the Faulcon, were very much amazed at it. But at length, the Faulcon, though with much adoe, being gotten from them, the Shepherds thought the Quarrell to be now certainly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:114719:207"/>and that they ſhould heare no more of theſe Out-cries. But, which much increaſed their Wonder, on the Morrow, they ſaw ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together, in the very ſame place, ſo infinite a number of Faulcons, and Ravens, as that they could not have believed before, that there were ſo many in the whole world: all which were now gathered together to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide this Difference, betwixt the Faulcon and the Ravens; the Place, and Combat being, as it were, agreed on, on both ſides. The Faulcons pitched their Battell toward the South ſide of the Place; and the Ravens to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the North: and both the One, and the Other, obſerved their Ranks, and Order as exactly, and beheld each other with as fierce Countenances, as if they had been Armies of Men. At length, after they had been obſerved to keep this Order, for ſome little time, (ſome of them being, as it were, in the Main Body of the Army; and others, in the Wings,) the Fight began, with ſuch Fury; as that, in an Inſtant, the place all about was covered with Feathers, and Bloud, and with dead bodies of both Parties. But in Concluſion, the Faulcons wonne the Day: and it ſeemed but Reaſonable; that They, who fought in ſo juſt a Cauſe, ſhould bear away the Victory. Now that this Battell, fought betwixt theſe Birds, did preſage ſome
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:114719:208"/>Battell to be fought by Men in the ſame place, <hi>Edovardus Scleikel</hi> endeavoureth to prove, by the Event: who writing the Hiſtory of the year 1391. tells us; that not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this happened, two Biſhops, pretending Right each of them to the Biſhoprick of <hi>Leige,</hi> were ſo incenſed againſt each other, as that filling all the parts round about with Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, they made a Sad, and Bloudy Deciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Controverſie. For, <hi>Benedict XII.</hi> and <hi>Gregory XIII.</hi> (whoſe Factions had likewiſe made a Diviſion in the Church, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Popedome,) maintaining each of them the Biſhop of his own Election, drave on the buſineſſe to ſo great a Height, as that it was to be determined only by the Sword. The <hi>Liegeois</hi> favoured the one Party; and <hi>John</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> the other. But in the end, the Duke being ſtronger then his Enemies, gave them Battell in the very ſame place, where theſe Birds had fought before; and wonne the Day, with the loſſe of three Thouſand of the <hi>Liegeois.</hi> The like alſo happened <hi>An.</hi> 1484. when <hi>Lewis, D. of Orleans</hi> fought againſt <hi>Charles</hi> VIII. And that I may not trouble my ſelf any further, in collecting Inſtances of this kind, you may have recourſe to the fore-named <hi>Scleikel,</hi> and <hi>Belle-foreſt,</hi> who will furniſh you with good ſtore of the like Preſages:<note place="margin">Hiſt. Prod.</note> it not being my
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:114719:208"/>Purpoſe to give you a Catalogue of them, but only to examine their Cauſe.</p>
                  <p>We ſay then, that Birds may Naturally foreſhew ſad Accidents approaching; if we except all ſuch, as depend upon the Will of Man; as, to give Battell, or, Not to give Battell: for, in this caſe, all Preſages are Vain. And if by Chance the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Battels were obſerved to be fought, after thoſe of the Birds; yet the Birds can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be thought to have fore-ſhewed them: ſince it is by meer Accident, that the Birds fought in the Aire, either before, or at the ſame time, that men fought upon the Earth: or elſe, perhaps, God may ſometimes make uſe of theſe Extraordinary Signes, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare us, (as we have ſaid before,) againſt the Evils that we are to encounter with.</p>
                  <p>To keep our ſelves therefore within the Compaſſe of Naturall Cauſes; we affirm, that we may foreſee Fair weather, Raine, Thunder, Peſtilence, the Overwhelming of Cities, and Hills, and alſo the Naturall Death of Men, by the Naturall Diſpoſition of Birds; and that, three manner of Waies. The Firſt is, by their <hi>Flight:</hi> the Second, by their <hi>Singing;</hi> or <hi>Crying:</hi> and the Third, by their <hi>Leaving,</hi> and <hi>Forſaking</hi> a Place, The Later of theſe doth manifeſtly foretell the Falling of Mountains, and of Cities, and
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:114719:209"/>Houſes; the Peſtilence, and Famine approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: And the Two Other fore-ſhew the Change of Weather, and the Naturall Death of Men. And here I cannot but wonder, that among all thoſe Hiſtorians, that have written of the Preſages of Birds; there is ſcarcely any of them that have endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to give the Natural Cauſes of them. They will tell you perhaps, that againſt Raine, ſome certain Birds will fly cloſe to the ſide of Rivers; but they do not tell, what ſhould be the Cauſe of their Flying thither, rather then to any other place. But, ſeeing that all theſe Actions are not done, without ſome Reaſon, or other; we ſhall here indeavour, in a few words, to diſcover what it may be.</p>
                  <p>It is certain then, that Birds which keep alwaies in the Air, have a more perfect Senſe, and Apprehenſion of the preſent Temper of It, then We can have: and this is the reaſon, why againſt all Changes of the Air, and of the Weather, they are wont to give us ſome Signe of it: as, for example, to Sing, and Chirp very pleaſantly, when the Aire is Clear, and Calm; and on the other ſide, to change their Note, when it begins to be troubled and overcaſt; and to fly to Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſides, when it is like to Rain; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lly thoſe that delight in eating of Worms;
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:114719:209"/>which abounding moſt about River's banks, by reaſon of the Corruption, and Humidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, alwaies come abroad out of the Earth, againſt Wet weather. And this is the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why Crowes fly to Rivers ſides, when it is like to Rain. Secondly, if the Aire begin to be infected with any Contagion; they, finding themſelves annoyed thereby, preſently get them gone, and quit the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; although it be ſo Fat, and plentifull a one, as that it affords them more ſtore of Food, then any other place can. Thirdly, they uſe to fly away, and forſake a City, or Hill, which is neer falling to Ruine, and to be Overwhelmed; by reaſon that the Hill, or City, not falling to the ground ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as it ſeems to Us to do; but, by little and little; there are cauſed by this meanes certain Rifts, and Openings in the Earth, out of which aſcends ſo Contagious an Aire, as that the Birds, (which are far quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Sented then We are,) perceiving it, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently leave the place, and fly away. Thus did thoſe Birds, which we have formerly mentioned, out of <hi>Rab. Elcha,</hi> fly all of them away, even as much as the very Poultry, when the City, wherein they were, was now ready to be overwhelmed by the Ruine of Two Mountains. We have alſo ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that in a certain Village, in <hi>Suitzerland,</hi>
                     <pb n="380" facs="tcp:114719:210"/>called <hi>PLOURS,</hi> the very Bees did the like. The Inſtance of a Man neer death, doth alſo confirm this Truth: for, when he is at his laſt Gaſp, the Pores being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, by a Certain Violent Labouring of Nature, ſend forth ſo Corrupt an Aire, or Sweat; that the very Fleas, not enduring it, leave the place. The ſame is alſo report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of Rats, and Mice; who will be ſure to forſake a houſe, that is ready to fall. And certainly no man can doubt, but that the Air which is pent up in the Cloſe holes, either of a Mountain, or of the Foundation of a City, or of the Walls of a Houſe, muſt needs be very Corrupt, and Putrified Air; which, when it commeth to be exhaled, muſt neceſſarily be very dangerous,<note place="margin">De Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et. l. <hi>3.</hi> c. <hi>3</hi>
                     </note> to all thoſe that ſhall take it in. And in this ſenſe we are to underſtand <hi>Cardan,</hi> when he ſaies; that a City is neer its Ruine, when the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens are obſerved to croak, more then uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally: foraſmuch as, theſe Birds having a Sent of the Putrid Air, that iſſueth out of the Earth, think it to be Carrion; after which they are ſo greedy, ſaith <hi>Aelian,</hi> as that get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the tops of Trees, or elſe flying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout in the Air, they turn themſelves about toward every blaſt of Wind, that ſo having a Sent of any, they may goe, and feaſt themſelves upon it. And for the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:114719:210"/>if they chance to flie over a houſe, where any are Sick, and that they alight upon it, and cry more then they uſe to doe; they have ſome Senſe, by reaſon of the Air that commeth out of the Sick perſons Chamber, of his approaching Death. The <hi>Augury</hi> therefore, or Divination by Birds, uſed by the Ancients, was not altogether ſo Ridiculous a thing, and fit to be accounted only as a Piece of Superſtitious Foolery;<note place="margin">Diſquiſ.

So that, when I hear a Hen make a Noiſe, I may ſay, that either ſhe hath found ſome Corn, and now ſhe calleth for her Young ones; or elſe, that now ſhe hath laid an Egge; or elſe, that ſhe is frighted.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hoſe, who have diligently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined the Choyceſt parts of the Learning of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, have obſerved, that there is nothing that is more Abſurd, in Appearance, then the Figures of the Celeſtiall Conſtellations. For, what a Confuſed thing is it, (ſay They) that, in thoſe places, which are deſtined to be the place of abode for the Bleſſed Spirits only, there ſhould be lodged ſuch numbers of Beaſts; and, ſome of them ſo dreadfull, as that we cannot thinke of them, but with Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour? If they had placed only Men there, and had allotted a <hi>Caſtor,</hi> and a <hi>Pollux,</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion there; this might have been interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted an Error of Love; which ſuffers us not to be content, in wiſhing ſmall Honours to thoſe we Love. This Conſideration might alſo have ſatisfied thoſe, who complained, that the Celeſtiall Figures were nothing elſe, but the Repreſentations of the ſeverall Scapes of <hi>Jupiter;</hi> &amp; that the whole Face of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens was filled, with the Notes of his Ince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuous Prankes: ſo that if any one ſhould un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:114719:212"/>to excuſe theſe Amorous Signes, he would be the leſſe blame-worthy; in that hee did it, only in Defence of the moſt ſweet, and Powerfull of all our Paſſions. The Excuſe of thoſe, who impoſed upon theſe Incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible Bodies, the Figures of Brute Beaſts that are moſt ſubject to Corruption, and even of Things Inanimate alſo, was moſt juſt; ſeeing that, in ſo doing, they had no other Deſigne, but what was Religious. Thus we ſee Fiſhes there, Cenſers, and Eares of Corn in a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins hand: And, thoſe who are skilled in the Secrets of the Ancient Theology, know well enough, that it was not without ſome Myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call reaſon, that they placed one Crowne in the South part of Heaven, conſiſting of Thirteen Bright Stars; and another in the Northern part, containing eight ſtars in it. But to place Dragons there, and Serpents, and Hydra's; Reaſon can never endure. And yet, ſee the Strangeneſſe of the thing! For Though the Ancienes had thus filled the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens with Brute Beaſts; and that, according to this their Doctrine, one would have ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined this Celeſtiall Paradiſe to have been, an Habitation of Monſters, and a Dreadfull Wilderneſs, rather then the Seat of the Bleſſed, &amp; a Place abounding with all manner of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; yet notwithſtanding neither hath the Church ever reproved it, nor any of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:114719:213"/>Fathers diſavowed it. Now the Subject we treat of, is much leſſe Scandalous; and, by Conſequence, more Tolerable. For, what danger can there be, in affirming; that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Figures of the Starres repreſent, and make up the different Characters of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> Alphabet? And, that as Theſe Letters have ſome Signification, when they are Single, as well as when they are joyned with others: in like manner the Stars, either alone, or joyned with other Stars, doe note unto us ſome Myſteries? Yea rather, this Doctrine of ours is ſo farre from being ſuch, as men ſhould beware of, and hold it Suſpected; as that, on the Contrary, it teacheth the Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Wonders of God; and proveth, that all theſe Stars have not their Order beſtowed on them in vaine; and that their Motions, and different Aſpects are not utterly uſeleſſe, and without any Deſigne. Inſomuch that, in my Opinion, it would be no leſſe then Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy in any man, to affirme the Contrary; or to ſay, that they are placed there, only for Ornament, and to beautifie the Heavens, and to give Light; and for no other cauſe at all. But, what Madneſſe is it to confine theſe Wonderful Lights to One only Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſeeing that, beſides that Experience tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth us, that the <hi>Moone</hi> is the Governeſſe of all Humours; the <hi>Sun,</hi> the Principle of Life;
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:114719:213"/>
                     <hi>Saturn,</hi> a Malignant Star; <hi>Jupiter,</hi> a Benign; the Signe of <hi>Taurus,</hi> cold and dry; that of <hi>Gemini,</hi> Hot and moiſt; <hi>Aries,</hi> Hot and dry; and ſo of the reſt: we do alſo ſee daily, that one and the ſame Simple here below, ſerveth to diverſe and ſundry Operations: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if the Properties of Hearbs, are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to the narrow limits of One Sole Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; why ſhould we thinke ſo unworthily of the Stars, as not to believe the ſame of them? Wee conclude therefore, that beſide thoſe Wonderfull Qualities, which wee acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to be in them; they may alſo repreſent, by their Diverſity of Aſpects, certaine Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, or Characters, by which we may have ſome Apprehenſion of the Greateſt Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, that happen here below. And this Truth we will now endeavour to prove, out of the Holy Scriptures.</p>

And <hi>John Leo,</hi> in his Hiſtory of <hi>Africk,</hi> affirmeth, that, in <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocco,</hi> there is nothing more Common: and the firſt book which he makes mention of, is a book written by <hi>Elboni,</hi> an Arabian, the Title whereof is, <hi>ELLYMAHEMORAMITH:</hi> which book ſcarcely treateth of any thing elſe; and it teacheth particularly, how to deſcribe all the Conſtellations in Arabick Letters, and to picture them Elegantly within little Tables; ſuch as the <hi>Arabian</hi> Hermites doe alwaies carry about them, and have them rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for their Uſe, in applying them to the Rules of their <hi>Zairagia,</hi> or Divination.

After the world had once been ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the Probability of this his Doctrine, he then intended to make a Full Diſcovery of all theſe Secrets, in his Commentaries up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Zohar:</hi> wherein he had layed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch Variety of Curious Learning, as himſelf witneſſeth in divers places of his Printed Books, as that it was not without reaſon that he ſo earneſtly commended This moſt Excellent Piece to the World, in his Laſt Will and Teſtament, written with his own hand.

                     <pb n="404" facs="tcp:114719:222"/>call them, that are ſounded in the furtheſt part of the Roofe of the Mouth; as others are by the Palate; by the Gummes; by the Lips; by the Teeth, and the Tongue toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and alſo into ſome, that are pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with a kind of Sibilation; others, with a certain Stammering; and ſome, with a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle turning of the Tongue, which They call, <hi>Dſalqijetun;</hi> and the Latines, <hi>Flexae:</hi> into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers agen, that are Short, Long, Radicall, or Trancall, and Servile: I ſay, that beſides all theſe Diviſions, they doe yet divide them againe, (the better to accommodate them to this <hi>Celeſtiall Writing</hi>) into <hi>Schemſijun,</hi> and <hi>Kumrijum,</hi> that is to ſay, into Solar, and Lunar, which are particularly knowne, by thoſe that obſerve the Rules of the <hi>Zairagia,</hi> it being unlawfull for them to deviſe them. And perhaps it is in Obſervation to this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, that the <hi>Mahometans</hi> doe never begin to write the firſt part of a word, at the end of a Line, and the reſt of it at the beginning of the next Line; as the <hi>Greekes,</hi> and <hi>Latines</hi> uſe to doe: but if the ſpace be not ſufficient to hold the whole word, they draw a ſtroake from the laſt Letter of the Laſt word, to the end of the Line. Now we affirme, that though theſe Letters are very much altered, and corrupted; yet may it notwithſtanding very eaſily be diſcovered, by the Figure of
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:114719:222"/>a great number of them, that they have beene taken from the <hi>Hebrew:</hi> and even Children may be able to judge of the Truth hereof, by comparing but the Arabicke <hi>Hha,</hi> with the Hebrew <hi>He;</hi> the <hi>Cha,</hi> with the <hi>Cheth;</hi> the <hi>Ra,</hi> with the <hi>Reſch;</hi> the <hi>Zain,</hi> with the <hi>Zain;</hi> the <hi>Sin,</hi> with the <hi>Schin;</hi> the <hi>Tha,</hi> with the <hi>Teth;</hi> the <hi>Ain,</hi> with the <hi>Aghin;</hi> the <hi>Pha,</hi> with the <hi>Pe;</hi> the <hi>Caph,</hi> with the <hi>Caph;</hi> the <hi>Lam,</hi> with the <hi>Lamed;</hi> the <hi>Vau,</hi> with the <hi>Vau,</hi> &amp;c. So that conſequently, if wee are to ſearch after any Myſteries in theſe Letters, it ought to be, not in a corrupt Copy, but rather in the Originall. The ſame is to be ſaid of the <hi>Samaritane</hi> Characters alſo, which are corrupted from the <hi>Hebrew:</hi> and this is ſo certaine a Truth, as that it is a Point of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Perverſeneſſe to offer to doubt of it; as I have proved elſe-where againſt <hi>Scali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</hi>
                  </p>

The Reaſons brought by the <hi>Ethiopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> or <hi>Egyptians,</hi> in the behalf of Their Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, is not ſo eaſily anſwered, as thoſe of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> and <hi>Samaritans:</hi> for as much as, their Letters being only <hi>Hieroglyphicks,</hi> expreſſing the figure of an Oxe, of a Horſe, of a Lion, of a Beare, of an Eagle, and in a manner of all other Living Creatures; they doe (ſay They) repreſent in the Heavens, whatſoever is to come to paſſe in this world.
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:114719:223"/>And therefore, if there be any thing to be read there above, by meanes of the Stars; we muſt reade it in theſe <hi>Hieroglyphicks,</hi> and in this Language, and not in any other; ſince that in Ancient times in ſtead of Letters, they made uſe of the figures of Living Creatures. To this it is anſwered, as we have formerly ſaid, that theſe Living Creatures have beene repreſented in the Heavens, only by reaſon of a certaine Correſpondency, that the Stars of which theſe Conſtellations conſiſt, are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to have, with theſe Living Creatures upon the Earth: and what other Reaſons of it ſoever are given, they are Vaine, and Foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh. Such as are thoſe, alleadged by the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forenamed <hi>Lazaro Banelli;</hi> who accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates the Properties of theſe Celeſtiall Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malls, to ſeverall Kingdomes, over which they rule: as, for Example, the Conſtellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Aries</hi> rules over <hi>France, Germany, Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, Paleſtina minor, Suevia,</hi> and the <hi>Upper Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſia.</hi> That of <hi>Taurus</hi> governs <hi>Perſia,</hi> the Iſles of the <hi>Archipelago, Cyprus,</hi> the Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time parts of <hi>Aſia Minor, Polonia major, Ruſsia alba, Switzerland,</hi> the Countrey of the <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres, Franconia, Ireland, Lorraine,</hi> and part of <hi>Swethland.</hi> But, to leave this <hi>Italian</hi> to pleaſe himſelfe with theſe Trifles, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>Albertus de Marcheſijs de Cottignola,</hi>

                     <pb n="407" facs="tcp:114719:223"/>after a way of his owne; we affirme, that all theſe Celeſtiall Living Creatures ſignifie no more then what we have ſaid before; and doe therefore by the ſame reaſon conclude, according to the judgement of the Rabbins, that we muſt not ſearch after any Myſteries, nor any other Characters, made up by the diverſe diſpoſition of the Stars, but only in the Hebrew; and conſequently, no Significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in any other Language, but in the Holy Language: it being moſt proper, that That Language, which was the Firſt in the whole World, and which was ſpoken by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, ſhould give us notice Above, what things are hereafter to come to paſſe; ſeeing it hath informed us here Below, namely in the Holy Scriptures, of all Things that are paſt. And this Concluſion is a moſt true one, ſay the ſame Rabbins, for as much as in a cleare, bright Night, a man may ſee in the Heavens all the Hebrew Characters perfectly figured: which one cannot doe of thoſe ſeverall Living Creatures, that are placed there; ſeeing that the Imagination cannot be any whit ſatisfied, when, for example, in the Stars that make up the Conſtellation of <hi>Aries,</hi> there are Five Other to be ſeene cloſe about it, which by reaſon that they are not compriſed within the Figure of this Beaſt, doe diſturb the Fancy, and hinder it from making up the Figure it
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:114719:224"/>deſires. The ſame alſo may be ſaid of <hi>Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus:</hi> for there are Eleven Starres to be ſeene there, which are Eſſentially of this Conſtel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; and yet are not brought in, in the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of it. So likewiſe in the Conſtellation of <hi>Gemini</hi> there are Eleven Stars belonging to it, which are diſtinguiſhed from thoſe Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen, that repreſent the Figure of this Signe: as <hi>Cancer</hi> alſo hath Foure bright Stars, which lie Looſe from thoſe Nine, which make up the Image of this Living Creature. But as for the Hebrew Letters, there is nothing to hinder us, from finding them diſtinctly deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed: and if any one doe chance to find either <hi>Arabicke,</hi> or <hi>Samaritane</hi> Letters there; this is ſtill but to returne backe to the Originall, from whence they were taken.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Firſt then we are to take notice, that the Starres which make up theſe Letters, are not diſpoſed into the order they appeare in, at all adventures, nor in any confuſed way, as they ſeeme to us to be: but are placed thus, with ſome Deſigne, and in a Divine Order; God having made all things in full Perfection. Thoſe that underſtand not the Play of <hi>Cheſſe,</hi> ſeeing the Pieces ſtand here and there, ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſedly, will be apt to thinke, no doubt, that they ſtand in that confuſed manner by meere haphazard, ſeeing that in ſome places there are a great many; and in ſome, very few;
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:114719:224"/>and one ſide of the Cheſſe-board is full, and the other ſide quite bare; and in a third place perhaps you ſhall have but two, or three: In a word, this Difference in the placing of the Pieces is ſo great, as that hee will certainely conclude, that the whole Buſineſſe is clearely without any Deſigne at all: notwithſtanding that they are all ranked in very exact Order; and that there is not the leaſt Piece there, but is of uſe, and doth its proper Office. After the ſame manner is it with the Stars, which we ſee in the Heavens: for, though in ſome places you ſee many together, &amp; in others but a few; and that the Order they ſtand in, lookes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſedly, and in a manner ridiculous; yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe is it moſt Admirable, in it ſelfe, and proceeds from ſome moſt wonderfull De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne; which Thoſe Men perfectly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, who by their Holy Life, are elevated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all that is here below. Thus it is ſtoried of S. <hi>Anthony,</hi> that he perfectly underſtood this <hi>Heavenly Writing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, that although the Stars which are in the Eighth Heaven, (if at leaſt there be any ſuch thing as an Eighth Heaven,) be Fixed; yet do they not therefore alwayes compoſe the ſame Letters; at leaſt, the greateſt part of them; but they have their Changes, according to the Diverſe Aſpects of the Planets. Thus thoſe Starres, that, ten yeares ſince, made
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:114719:225"/>up, for Example, a <hi>Teth,</hi> ſhall now perhaps make a <hi>Mem,</hi> or a <hi>Lamed.</hi> Which is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſay the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> that <hi>This Writing</hi> ſerves not, but for the ſhewing of things to come.</p>
                  <p>In the Third place they ſay, that we are moſt eſpecially to obſerve what New Starres ſoever ſhall appeare; becauſe that Theſe doe fore-ſhew the greateſt Mutations: God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king uſe of theſe, in making up, by meanes of their Aſpects, and Conjunctions, New Letters; whereby he either expreſſeth unto us his Wrath, or his Mercy: as having deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined with himſelfe, to chaſtiſe us, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in our ſins; and to pardon us, if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of them. Thus, before almoſt all the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Mutations, that have happened in the World, have ſome of theſe New Stars been obſerved to appeare; and they have been ſuch Stars too, as have been really found to be in the very Heavens. Such, as was That, obſerved by <hi>Hipparchus,</hi> 125. yeares before the time of our Redemption; which Star pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaged the end of the <hi>Grecian Monarchy</hi> approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching. Another the like appeared alſo in <hi>Claudean's</hi> time, in the yeare of our <hi>Saviour Chriſt</hi> 388. Another, in the time of <hi>Meſſaha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lah, Haly,</hi> and <hi>Alhumazar, Arabian</hi> Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers; which appeared in the 15. <hi>Degree</hi> of <hi>Scorpio,</hi> and caſt forth as great a Light, as

As, for Example, in this Word AKE, if one adde an L, it will be no longer AKE, but LAKE. Or if in the middeſt of this word AKE, one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert an R, it will alter the word, and make it ARKE. So that wee ſee, one onely Letter, as an L, or an R, utterly changeth the whole Senſe. In the ſame manner is it with the Stars; where a New Starre added, varieth both the Writing, and the Senſe.</p>
                  <pb n="413" facs="tcp:114719:226"/>
                  <p n="9">9. In the Fourth place, that we may be able perfectly to underſtand this <hi>Celeſtiall Writing,</hi> we muſt exactly obſerve the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall Stars: for, thoſe which are over a Kingdome, ſaith <hi>Abiudan,</hi> doe ordinarily ſhew; what ever is like to befall it. And in this Senſe, it will not be any hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to apprehend the meaning of <hi>Cardan,</hi> when he ſaies, ſpeaking of the Star in the Tail of <hi>Urſa Major,</hi> that it hath fore-ſhewed the Changes of all the Great Empires: un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding this to be the Senſe of this Truth, delivered by <hi>Cardan;</hi> that, according to the Doctrine here laid down, this Star, though not Alone, and by it ſelf, yet joyned with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, hath ſhewed theſe Changes; making up, by their Conjunction, ſuch Entire words, as did fore-ſhew the Fall, or Riſe of theſe Empires, either clearly, and plainly; or elſe perhaps, more ſecretly, and Myſtically, as we ſhall ſhew hereafter. Now, as in all ſorts of Writing, there is One certain Letter, both in <hi>Nounes</hi> and <hi>Verbs,</hi> which is more Frequent then any other; and hath the Preeminence throughout all the ſeverall <hi>Conjugations,</hi> and <hi>Declenſions;</hi> in like manner in this <hi>Celeſtiall Writing,</hi> it hath been obſerved, that in all the Mutations of Empires, This Star, in the Taile of the aforeſaid Conſtellation, hath been more Eminently noted, then any other:
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:114719:227"/>Either becauſe it is more Frequent, in the Diſcourſe of Monarchies, then any other: Or elſe, that it is as the Capitall Letter, in the moſt Significative Words; as we ſee there is in all Proper Names, of almoſt all the Languages in the World: as for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in the name of <hi>Peter,</hi> the firſt Letter is greater, then any of the reſt that follow. And thus may we anſwer this Queſtion, which ſome may happily make; namely, Why, in this Celeſtiall Writing, there are both Little, and Great Stars alſo? If it be further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded; Why, in this kind of <hi>Writing,</hi> there are, in one and the ſame word, Great, and Small Letters, or Stars, mingled together? it may be anſwered, that the Reaſon is, to make us take more Notice of thoſe Letters in the Word, which are the Moſt Significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; which is a Courſe, that the <hi>Anagram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiſts</hi> are very well acquainted withall. As, for Example, if in the word <hi>Soveraignty,</hi> I would have <hi>VERITY,</hi> to be eſpecially obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, I will write the word <hi>Soveraignty,</hi> in this manner, ſoVERaIgnTY: where the Letters of the Word <hi>VERITY,</hi> are greater, then any of the reſt. Or if in the Word, <hi>Repreſentative,</hi> I would have, <hi>Preſent,</hi> to be Chiefly taken notice of, I would then write the Whole Word thus; rePRESENTa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. We are not then to wonder, if in the
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:114719:227"/>Heavens we often ſee two, or three Great Stars to goe to the Compoſition of a Word, wherein there are Small Stars alſo: and this is that, which we are to have moſt particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar regard unto, (as we have already ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, When they are <hi>Verticall</hi> to any Place. And by this meanes may we be able to give a Reaſon of that, which hath been hitherto Unknown: as, when the Aſtrologers affirm, that when <hi>Caput Algol,</hi> or <hi>Meduſa's</hi> Head, was Verticall to <hi>Greece;</hi> the Stars did fore-ſhew the Calamities, which afterwards hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened unto it, by the Tyranny of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans;</hi> without giving us any Reaſon Why: no more then they doe of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, in aſſuring us, that the ſame Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellation, which will in a ſhort time be Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall to <hi>Italy</hi> alſo, fore-ſhewes a ſtrange De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, that is to fall upon this Pleaſant, and Fertile Country. Now all theſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſters, though, according as they are fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, ſo doe they Certainly come to paſſe; yet nevertheleſſe is the Fore-ſeeing of them grounded meerely upon Experience; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can the Authors of theſe Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for the Moſt part, give any other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of them. But now, according to this Doctrine of the <hi>Celeſtiall Writing,</hi> we know, that theſe Mutations ſhall happen on the Earth, becauſe we ſee, they are written in the
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:114719:228"/>Heavens. And this is the Reaſon that <hi>R.

                  <p n="10">10. In the Fifth Place, the fore-named Authors affirm, that to be able perfectly to underſtand this <hi>Celeſtiall Writing,</hi> we muſt know how to diſtinguiſh exactly, which Stars are <hi>Orientall,</hi> and which <hi>Occidentall, Meridionall,</hi> and <hi>Septentrionall:</hi> foraſmuch as theſe Quarters of the Heaven are very Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall in this Reading. For, if any one deſire to know, ſay They, the Good Fortune, and Proſperitie of a Kingdome, or of any Other thing: he muſt then read thoſe Letters which are <hi>Verticall</hi> to him, (or which want not much of being ſo,) from the Weſt, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Eaſt. And if he would be inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Evill Accidents, and Misfortunes
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:114719:229"/>that ſhall befall a place; he muſt then begin to read, from the North, towards the Weſt. Now, why the Good Fortunes of a Place ſhould be read, from the Weſt, toward the Eaſt, rather then from the Eaſt, toward the South: and why the Ill Fortune is likewiſe to be read, from the North, toward the Weſt; I have not found any Reaſon given, by any Author. However, I ſhall adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to give this Conjecture at it: namely; that ſeeing that Nature, being at Liberty, and not hindered by any thing, alwaies tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the Beſt: and that, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, It would alwaies bring forth <hi>Males,</hi> as being more Perfect Creatures then <hi>Females</hi> are, if it were not hindered by ſome Repugnant Cauſe: it is moſt proper, that Good Things, and all Perfections, ſhould be read from the Weſt toward the Eaſt, ſeeing that This is the Free, and Naturall Motion of the Stars; the other, from the Eaſt to the Weſt, being a Contrary, and Forced Motion. As for Ill Fortune, and Diſaſters, they might accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this Principle, have been read from the Eaſt toward the Weſt, had not the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle which cannot lye, uttered this Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull Truth: <hi>A Septentrione pandetur ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum:</hi>

<pb n="420" facs="tcp:114719:230"/>of this is not ſo eaſily given: yet I conceive, it would ſtand with ſound Philoſophy, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; that, by reaſon of the Darkneſſe, and Gloomineſſe of the Aire of thoſe Parts; cauſed by the great diſtance of the Sun; and alſo, by reaſon of the Evill Spirits, which are the Authors of ſo much Evill, and which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habite Darke Places; a man may very Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably ſay, that all Misfortunes come from the North; as being a Place, which is full of theſe Evill Spirits, or <hi>Demons;</hi> as Hiſtorians teſtifie.</p>
                  <p>And from hence, it will be an eaſie matter to apprehend the Reaſon, why the Ancients figured in theſe Northerne Parts of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, a <hi>Serpent,</hi> or <hi>Dragon,</hi> cloſe by the Two <hi>Beares:</hi>

                  <p n="11">11. we will now diſcover, according to theſe Rules laid down, ſome certain Secrets of this <hi>Celeſtiall Writing,</hi> which are delivered by <hi>R.

We have formerly ſhewed, how the Stars of the Conſtellation called, <hi>Caput Algol,</hi> being Verticall to <hi>Greece,</hi> did foreſhew the Deſolation of it. The like is to be obſerved in the reſt of the Stars, when they are Verticall to any other Kingdome, though they are perhaps ordered, and to be underſtood otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>Thus, a little before the Temple of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> was burnt, and utterly conſumed by <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buzaradan,</hi> it was obſerved, that Eleven of the Stars, that were the moſt Verticall to it, compoſed, for a pretty while together, theſe five Letters, <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="425" facs="tcp:114719:232"/>the Weſt,) <hi>Hikſchich;</hi> which ſignifieth, <hi>to Reject, and Forſake, without any Mercie:</hi> and the Number of Three of them added toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, amounteth to 423. which is the Space of Time, that this Stately piece of Building had ſtood. In like manner, a little before the Jewes ſaw their Scepter caſt downe to the ground, and their Liberty carried Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive into <hi>Babylon,</hi> Five Stars were, for a long time together, obſerved to compoſe theſe Three Myſticall Letters, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>Nataq,</hi> a word which ſignifieth, to <hi>Break, Caſt Down,</hi> and to <hi>Drive out.</hi> And the Number of theſe Letters, which is 505. was the Exact Number of years that the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Kingdome had laſted, from <hi>Saul,</hi> to the Deplorable King <hi>Zedechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as.</hi> Neither are the <hi>Jewes</hi> the only People, who have been advertiſed, by this <hi>Celeſtiall Writing,</hi> of the Miſeries that were to befall them: but all the other Nations of the World might have read in the Heavens in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the Evils that have happened unto them; as the fore-named Authors affirm.</p>
                  <p>Thus the <hi>Perſians,</hi> or <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> who were the Ruine of the Monarchy of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> ſaw the Period of their own Empire, after that Foure of their Verticall Stars had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed

The Firſt is, that of the <hi>Turkes;</hi> over which there are obſerved ſeven Verticall Stars, which being read from the Weſt to the Eaſt, (for, it would be a great Bleſſing, to ſee the

For, the Middle Letter, which is <hi>Aleph,</hi> being made up of Brighter, and more Sparkling Stars, then the Others are, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, ſaith <hi>Chomer,</hi> that Its Number is the Greater; ſo that, in This place it ſtandeth for 1000. and the Firſt letter ſignifieth, 20. and the Laſt, 5. So that, when this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſhall have accompliſhed the number of 1025. years, it ſhall then be overthrowne, and brought to Ruine. Now, if we reckon from the year of our Lord 630. which was the year, (according to our Vulgar Compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,) wherein the Foundation of this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire was laid; we ſhall find, that it is to laſt till the year of our Lord 1655. for the compleating of the aforeſaid number 1025. ſo that, reckoning from this preſent yeare, 1650. this Kingdome is to laſt but Five years longer.</p>
                  <p>The Other Eaſtern Kingdome, whoſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining is pointed out by the Stars, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>K. Chomer,</hi> is that of <hi>China:</hi> but this <hi>Rabbin</hi> delivers himſelf in ſuch an Obſcure
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:114719:234"/>manner, in diſcourſing of this laſt piece of <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall Writing;</hi> as that, till I underſtand it better, I ſhall forbeare to ſet it downe. Hee produceth alſo diverſe Others, which doe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine the Particular Durations of moſt of the Kingdomes of <hi>Europe:</hi> all which I may happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly communicate to the World hereafter, when I have firſt ſeene, how theſe <hi>Curioſities</hi> are received.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Now, that I may freely deliver my owne Judgment concerning this <hi>Celeſtiall Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi> I muſt take Liberty to propoſe ſome few Objections, which, I have found, may be brought againſt it.</p>
                  <p>The Firſt is, that if ſo be, by this <hi>Writing,</hi> all the Great Mutations in the World may be known; it is poſſible then, that the End of the World may in like manner be found out by It; as being the Greateſt, and moſt Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant of all the reſt: ſo that Men may, by a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Meanes, attain to the knowledge of This Great Secret: which is Contrary to the Holy Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>The Second is, that Aſtrologers have been able to foretel many of theſe Mutations, which have afterwards come to paſſe accordingly; and yet have never had any knowledge of This ſtrange Kind of <hi>Writing:</hi> It is therefore Uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, and Imaginary.</p>
                  <p>The Third is, that the Poſition of the Stars
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:114719:235"/>is not ſo Eſſentiall to the Letter, which it is brought to make up; but that the ſame Star may as well make, for Example, a <hi>Reſch,</hi> as a <hi>Daleth;</hi> and ſo of all the reſt: and Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, Severall Men, forming ſeveral Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of the ſame Starres, may draw from them Contrary ſenſes, the one to the other.</p>
                  <p>But to all theſe Objections, I anſwer brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thus. To the Firſt, I ſay, that it is not Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that this <hi>Celeſtiall Writing</hi> ſhould fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhew the end of the World; becauſe that God may have reſerved this Secret to Himſelfe: Or elſe;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Math.</hi> 24.29. <hi>Mar.</hi> 13.24. <hi>Luc.</hi> 21.25.</note> that It will Really foretel This hereafter; when thoſe Other Signes, ſet downe by the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts, ſhall ſhew it alſo: it being all one to ſay, that the Starres ſhall fore-ſhew it by ſome certaine <hi>Writing;</hi> as to ſay, that the <hi>Sun,</hi> and the <hi>Moone</hi> ſhall foretell it, by their being Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
                  <p>To the Second, I anſwer; that the Foure Grand Cauſes,<note place="margin">Card. <hi>1.</hi> Aph.</note> which (according to the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Aſtrologers) produce the greateſt Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; the Firſt whereof is, the Changing of the <hi>Apogaeum,</hi> and <hi>Perigaeum</hi> of the Planets: the Second, the Changing of the Excentrici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the <hi>Sun,</hi> of <hi>Venus,</hi> of <hi>Mercury,</hi> of <hi>Saturne,</hi> of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and of <hi>Mars:</hi> the Third, the diverſe Figure of the Obliquity of the Zodiacke; and the Fourth, the Conjunction, (cheifly the Great one) of the Superiour Planets: I ſay,
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:114719:235"/>that all theſe Foure Cauſes may, for the moſt part, be comprized within this <hi>Celeſtiall Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting:</hi> that is to ſay, that it hath happened very often, that at what time this <hi>Celeſtiall Writing</hi> did point out ſome great Change, there was at the ſame time alſo a Conjunction of the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Planets; or elſe, ſome one of the Three other forenamed Cauſes. So that They, not underſtanding any thing of this <hi>Celeſtiall Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi> imputed thoſe changes which they obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to come to paſſe, to thoſe Foure Reaſons only. But that it may clearly appeare unto us, that Theſe have not been the True Cauſes of all theſe Changes; we need but have recourſe to the <hi>Chronologies,</hi> and Particular Annals of each ſeverall Kingdome, and compare them with the Aſtrologicall Obſervations; and wee ſhall finde, that the greateſt part of all the Grand Mutations have happened, without any Conjunction of the Greater Planets, or any of the other Cauſes before ſpecified. So that we muſt neceſſarily flye to ſome other more Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Means, by which we may be able to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>know, by the Aſpects, and Motions of the Stars, all theſe Events. Now this Means can be no Other, as it ſeemeth, but this <hi>Celeſtiall Writing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To the Third Objection, which ſeemeth to have the moſt Weight in it, it may be anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that it is true indeed, that a Man may make
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:114719:236"/>a <hi>Reſch</hi> of the ſame Star, that another man per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps will make a <hi>Daleth</hi> of: but in This, as in many other things, wee are to follow the Tradition of the Ancients, and to reſt ſatisfied with what They have delivered unto us. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, there will not be any Certainty at all, in any One of the reſt of the Sciences; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in Aſtrology: which requireth, that thoſe Stars which compoſe, for Example, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellation of <hi>Aries,</hi> or the <hi>Ramme,</hi> ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed rather in the Figure of this Beaſt, then in that of an <hi>Oxe,</hi> or a <hi>Horſe;</hi> and ſo in all the reſt. So that who ever ſhould repreſent the Figure of a <hi>Bull,</hi> among the Stars that belong to the <hi>Ramme;</hi> and the Figure of a <hi>Ramme,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe of the <hi>Bull;</hi> he would deſtroy the very Principles of Aſtrology: notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Stars of <hi>Taurus</hi> would as well bear the Figure of a <hi>Ramme,</hi> as of a <hi>Bull.</hi> In like manner, he that ſhould make a <hi>Reſch</hi> of ſuch a Star, as he ſhould have made a <hi>Daleth</hi> of; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that the Star would beare it, yet would he overthrow the Principles of this <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall Writing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If it be now demanded; who it is, that is to judge of the vaſt number of New Letters that are made daily, by the Diverſe Aſpects of the Planets? I anſwer; that it appertaineth to thoſe Men, who are Piouſly, and Religiouſly ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in this <hi>Heavenly Writing;</hi> and, not to all
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:114719:236"/>kind of Perſons indifferently. But I ſhall as yet ſuſpend my own Judgment, as wel in This, as in all the reſt of theſe <hi>Curioſities,</hi> which I have here delivered; till ſuch time as I ſhall have found either Weaker, or Stronger Reaſons.</p>
